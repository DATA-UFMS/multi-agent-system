Chatbots are one of the most popular new messaging channels today. And the little chat bubble you spot on so many websites has become popular for a reason, even though on a wide range of sites, most people are used for talking to a real person. 

By simulating a text chat with a human, chatbots work for various business use cases, from automating customer conversations to connecting potential customers to salespeople. 

Integrating them into your business processes can help you engage with customers in a whole new way. In this article, we’ll explore the best chatbot tools and examples of conversational marketing to help you get the most out of your bot so you can leverage this emerging channel for maximum impact. 

##  What is a chatbot? 

A chatbot is a software designed to simulate human conversation with website visitors. At its core, a chatbot is a messaging platform that automates the dialogue between a customer and a business. Chatbots are often used in customer service, [ ecommerce marketing ](https://www.activecampaign.com/ecommerce) , sales, and marketing to reduce human intervention and help users get answers to their questions more quickly. 

##  Why use a chatbot? 

When customers have a question, they want answers fast. Chatbots are an effective messaging channel to quickly provide information and answers without needing a support person for every customer visiting a website. 

It’s also an excellent way for businesses to avoid answering the same simple questions repeatedly while simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction with instant answers. You can create the perfect responses once, and a chatbot can answer those common questions every time without needing a human agent. 

Chatbots can also automate and streamline processes, such as taking orders, scheduling demos, and collecting customer feedback. An example is if customers need to chat with the customer support team. 

In that case, chatbots are great at recognizing the need for human intervention and connecting visitors to the right people who can help. Chatbots save time and resources, while also improving user experience with speedier responses and resolutions. 

##  What types of chatbots exist? 

Generally, you can split chatbots into two types: artificial intelligence (AI) powered chatbots and rule-based chatbots. You may already be familiar with chatbots if you have ever used voice platforms like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. However, in this article, we'll focus on text-based conversions in web browsers and mobile devices. 

###  **Rule-based chatbots**

Marketing, sales, and customer service agents frequently use rule-based chatbots. These chatbots rely on predefined decision trees and provide pre-written responses. Users are presented with options to click, and the bot will answer them and provide follow-up options. 

These chatbots are inexpensive and quick to implement. However, with thoughtful conversational design and in-depth customer research, these chatbots can provide a great customer experience. 

###  **AI-powered chatbots**

Chatbots that use an artificial intelligence platform can understand and respond to natural language questions or requests and use machine learning algorithms to learn from user inputs. They can analyze and interpret complex questions to generate an appropriate response, but these AI-powered chatbots take a lot of resources and time to implement correctly. 

That said, for some businesses, the investment is worth it because it can be used to support or take over customer service, marketing, and education efforts by responding to a natural, human-like tone. 

##  Best chatbots 

If you’re interested in expanding your communication [ channels ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/channel-marketing) by adding a chatbot to your website, we compiled a list of the best chatbots for 2024. Keep reading to find one that best fits your business and technology suite.
