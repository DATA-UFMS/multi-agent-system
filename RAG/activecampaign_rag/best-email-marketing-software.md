##  What is email marketing software? 

Email marketing software is a tool that helps businesses create and send email campaigns to a large number of recipients at once. This software allows marketers to manage their email lists, create personalized content, and track the performance of their campaigns. Email marketing software typically includes features such as customizable templates, email scheduling, automation, A/B testing, and analytics. 

To use [ email marketing ](https://www.activecampaign.com/email-marketing) software, businesses typically start by importing their email list into the platform. They can then create email campaigns using customizable templates or by designing their own emails from scratch. The software allows businesses to [ personalize ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/personalize) emails with recipient names, location-based information, and other relevant data to increase engagement. Once the email is created, businesses can schedule it to be sent at a specific time or send it immediately. 

After sending the email, the software provides analytics to help businesses track the performance of their campaigns. These metrics include open rates, [ click-through rates ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/email-ctr) , and conversion rates, among others. Marketers can use this data to optimize their campaigns for better results in the future. 

##  What are the benefits of email marketing software? 

Email marketing software has become an essential tool for businesses to reach their customers and prospects through email. Some of the benefits of using email marketing software include: 

  * **Targeted messaging:** Email marketing software allows businesses to segment their audience based on various factors such as demographics, past purchases, browsing behavior, and more. This [ segmentation ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/segmenting) enables the delivery of personalized and relevant content, increasing the likelihood of engagement and conversion. 


  * **Cost-effective:** Compared to traditional marketing methods like print, television, or radio advertising, email marketing can be much more cost-effective. There are no production costs, no postage fees, and no advertising rates. The software might come with a subscription fee, but given the potential return on investment, it often proves to be a cost-effective solution for businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones. 


  * **Automation:** Email marketing software often comes with automation features, allowing businesses to create email workflows that trigger based on specific user actions. For instance, an automated [ welcome email series ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/welcome-email-series) can be set up for new subscribers, or a cart abandonment email can be sent when a customer leaves items in their online shopping cart. This automation saves time and resources while ensuring timely communication with customers. 


  * **Analytics and reporting:** Email marketing software provides a wealth of data about your company’s email campaigns. Open rates, click-through rates, conversions, [ bounce rates ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/bounce-rate) , and more are tracked and presented in easy-to-understand reports. These analytics allow marketers to evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to optimize future efforts. 


  * **Scalability:** As a business grows, its audience will too. Email marketing software can easily accommodate this growth, allowing businesses to scale their email marketing efforts without significant additional effort or cost. This scalability makes it a viable marketing tool for businesses of all sizes, from startups to large corporations. 



##  How to choose the best email marketing software 

Choosing the right email marketing software for your business is an important decision that can have a significant impact on your marketing efforts. 

**Here are some primary considerations to keep in mind when selecting the best email marketing software for your business:**

  * **Features:** Different email marketing software comes with different features, so it's important to choose software that offers the features you need to accomplish your marketing goals. Some important features to look for include customizable templates, automation, [ A/B testing ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/ab-testing-guide) , and analytics. 


  * **Ease of use:** The email marketing software you choose should be easy to use and navigate, even if you don't have technical expertise. Look for software that offers a user-friendly interface and provides clear instructions on how to use different features. 


  * **Integration:** Consider whether the email marketing software you choose integrates with other tools and platforms that your business uses, such as your [ CRM ](https://www.activecampaign.com/sales-crm) or e-commerce platform. This can streamline your workflow and improve the efficiency of your marketing efforts. 


  * **Pricing:** Email marketing software is available at different price points, so consider your budget when choosing software. Look for software that offers pricing plans that fit your budget, while still offering the features you need. 


  * **Customer support:** Consider the level of customer support offered by the email marketing software provider. Look for software that offers responsive customer support through different channels such as phone, email, or chat.
