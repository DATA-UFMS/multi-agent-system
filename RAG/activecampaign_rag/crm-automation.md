Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software is no longer just for large companies or industries with long sales cycles. More and more, CRMs are a vital tool for businesses of all sizes. But when you get caught up in all the minute details of the process, it can create unnecessary work. 

So if you want the organization and data that a [ CRM ](https://www.activecampaign.com/sales-crm) offers without the manual tasks that keep your team from high-impact work, CRM automation is the answer. This post will cover what CRM automation is, why you need it, and some of the best CRM automation platforms available.

##  What is CRM automation? 

When we say the word ‘CRM,’ we’re usually talking about the tools used for customer relationship management. So, CRM automation generally refers to the technology we use to automate the manual or repetitive tasks involved in customer relationship management. 

CRMs are an important tool because they allow your teams to manage and share data across marketing, sales, and customer service and, ultimately, provide a better [ customer experience ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/improve-customer-experience) (leading to more sales and retention). In fact, [ 74% ](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/sales-solutions/resources/pdfs/state-of-sales_pocketguide_r11_v2.pdf) of businesses said they considered these tools “extremely critical or critical in closing deals.” 

[ CRM automation ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/crm-automation) involves tasks related to all 3 areas of customer relationship management: marketing, sales, and customer success. For example, data entry and syncing are 1 of the biggest time savers when it comes to CRM automation. This lets your sales and customer service teams spend less time typing and more time selling and helping customers. For marketers, CRM automation can play a huge role in nurturing leads or segmenting them for more tailored communications. 

But CRM automation doesn’t have to be incredibly complex and high-tech. After all, 1 of the most-requested [ CRM software features ](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/crm-trends-2019/#2) is scheduling and reminders. [ Automating ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/automating) these tasks can save a ton of time. 

![Balkendiagramm der gewünschten CRM-Funktionen](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2022_10_Top-requested-CRM-features.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732062191&s=a423dc0b78ef7c142a2266cd1a87a0b6) ![Balkendiagramm der gewünschten CRM-Funktionen](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2022_10_Top-requested-CRM-features.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732062191&s=a423dc0b78ef7c142a2266cd1a87a0b6)

Requested CRM features 

##  Benefits of CRM automation 

CRM automation can have a huge impact on how well your business runs. Here are some of the biggest benefits businesses reap from CRM automation. 

**Saved time and increased productivity:** Instead of adding a data entry task to their to-do list, your team can let the automated workflow take care of it. For instance, auto-enrichment of contacts uses information available online to fill in contact data and company details (instead of each sales rep scouring the Internet for each lead). Email and chat conversations can be automatically added to contact records with the right integrations. 

And when information is shared automatically, it prevents idle time where 1 team is waiting for another to update an entry. 

This not only gets the individual tasks done faster, but it also frees up your team for other work. Would you rather have your sales team transcribe and copy notes or be on the phone with more prospects? 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2022_10_Save-time-at-every-CRM-step.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732062189&s=e94be2c6863f2c098f6886095b146f43) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2022_10_Save-time-at-every-CRM-step.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732062189&s=e94be2c6863f2c098f6886095b146f43)

Flow charts with and without wait times 

**Shorter sales cycle:** Since the individual tasks get done faster (including much of the data entry), sales team members spend less time waiting for data, and customers spend less time waiting for sales outreach. It can also prevent tasks from falling through the cracks—an issue that can unintentionally add weeks or months to a sales process. 

With [ 44% ](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/sales-solutions/resources/pdfs/state-of-sales_pocketguide_r11_v2.pdf) of businesses agreeing that the length of the sales cycle has increased, brands should do all they can to avoid delays. 

**Better customer engagement and experience:** CRM automation helps you deliver updates and information to customers faster. When someone fills out a form for more information, your CRM can automatically create a lead record and assign the lead to a sales rep. That means your team can reach out immediately. 

Since [ 28.3% ](https://www.drift.com/books-reports/state-of-conversational-sales/) of sellers believe that slow responsiveness and sales follow-up are 1 of their buyers’ biggest frustrations, the ability to respond and engage leads faster is no small feat. 

And when contact records are automatically updated with sales or customer service interactions, your team has access to the full picture of each customer’s experience. With a comprehensive contact record, your customer service team can ask fewer introductory questions and jump into problem-solving. 

It’s not shocking that companies where more than 75% of the team collaborates on and shares content achieve [ higher growth ](https://www.yesware.com/blog/sales-team-collaboration/#sales-team-collaboration-across-203-companies) than less communicative companies. 

##  CRM automation examples 

To really understand how CRM automation plays into sales, marketing, and customer service, let’s look at some examples. 

###  Automated lead creation and assignment 

CRM automation can begin from the very moment someone enters your sales funnel. When someone fills out a form on your website, this can trigger an automation that creates a contact record in your CRM. Another automation can then assign that lead to a particular sales rep. These [ contact management ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/contact-management) automations ensure prospective customers get in your system and in front of a team member faster. 

###  Automated welcome emails 

Brands in many industries begin nurturing new contacts with a [ welcome email ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/welcome-email-examples) or [ welcome series ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/welcome-email-series) . You can implement CRM automations that immediately send a welcome email when a new contact is created. 

###  Automated personalized email sequences 

As you nurture a lead and move them toward becoming a customer, it pays to start sending more personalized content. But that can be incredibly time-intensive unless you use CRM automation to send them. To make the message more personal, you can send pre-written emails from individual sales reps that insert data from the contact record (contact first name, company name, etc.). 

###  Automated chatbot and customer service data entry 

Most of the previous examples have been for sales and marketing teams, but the right CRM can also automate customer service interactions. Customers can automatically receive the information they’re looking for when they start a chat. 

###  Automated lead scoring 

[ Lead scoring ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/lead-scoring-101) is an important part of the sales process, particularly for industries with longer buying cycles. By setting up lead scoring rules in your CRM, the system can automatically calculate lead scores by incorporating the data and behaviors recorded along the way. 

As soon as a contact reaches the scoring threshold, the CRM can automatically notify the sales team that they need to take action. 

##  CRM and marketing automation 

Even if you haven’t used CRM automation before, you might be familiar with some forms of [ marketing automation ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/marketing-automation-software) . So what’s the difference? Is CRM automation the same as marketing automation? 

The main difference is that marketing automation specifically applies to marketing tasks. CRM automation involves workflows and streamlining tasks for all those who touch your CRM: sales, customer service, and marketing. For example, CRM automation can include [ audience segmentation ](http://www.activecampaign.com/blog/audience-segmentation) for your marketing team, but it can also include automated lead assignments geared toward helping your sales team. 

It’s also worth noting that some CRMs won’t have the capability to serve as your only marketing automation software. ActiveCampaign has [ advanced automation features ](https://www.activecampaign.com/marketing-automation) that other CRMs may not offer. 

##  Top 5 CRM automation tools 

Now that you understand the core functions and benefits of CRM automation, we’ll cover some of the top CRM automation tools available.
