#  How To Choose a Customer Engagement Platform 

###  Definition 

Every business, regardless of industry, sells a customer experience in today's market. That means you must prioritize customer engagement and a great product or service. 

More and more brands are using customer engagement platforms to manage how they communicate, respond to, and continually delight customers. This is raising the bar—both for the quality of the customer experience and for customer engagement platforms. 

Understanding how to choose and implement customer engagement software allows your business to provide outstanding customer experiences, no matter the size of your team. 

In this article, we’ll cover what a customer engagement platform is, the benefits of using one, examples of customer engagement, and how to choose the right platform for your business. 

##  Table of contents 

  * What is a customer engagement platform? 
  * The benefits of using a customer engagement platform 
  * Examples of customer engagement 
  * How to choose a customer engagement platform 
  * Top 5 customer engagement platforms 
  * Frequently asked questions 



##  What is a customer engagement platform? 

A customer engagement platform is software that helps businesses analyze, manage, and optimize the customer journey. Customer engagement platforms improve customer happiness, sales, and retention by sending personalized messages to your audience. 

With [ 75% of customers ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics) choosing brands with personalized messaging, offers, and experiences, it’s no surprise that more businesses are turning to customer engagement platforms to help reach people on their terms: 

  * [ Email ](https://www.activecampaign.com/email-marketing)
  * [ Social media ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customer-messaging/facebook-custom-audiences)
  * [ Live chat ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customer-messaging/conversations)
  * [ SMS ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customer-messaging/sms-marketing)

![A graphic with a customer engagement platform at the center with lines connecting it to different communication channels](https://www.activecampaign.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-engagement-channels-and-platform-1024x586.png) Customer engagement platforms 

Customer engagement tools also help businesses utilize a wider range of customer data to create more personalized experiences. 

##  The benefits of using a customer engagement platform 

With [ 70% of consumers ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics) saying a company’s understanding of their individual needs influences their loyalty, customer experience must be at the core of your business strategy. 

And yet, the customer journey is so much more of a squiggle than a straight line: 

![A straight line from A to B and a squiggly line from A to B](https://www.activecampaign.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-journey-is-not-a-straight-line-1024x432.png) Customer journey 

Whether chatting with your customers on your website, on Facebook, or via SMS, engagement tools make it easier for customers to engage with your business. 

Without even needing to ask, and often before they even know they have a problem, customer engagement platforms make customers feel seen and heard with: 

  * Personalized recommendations 
  * Answers to commonly asked questions 
  * Resolutions to their problems 



This is all done within the customer’s preferred digital channel, further increasing the likelihood of a positive experience. 

Earning trust and loyalty has never been harder or easier. The competitive landscape has trained consumers to expect fast and personalized experiences, while engagement tools have made it easier for small businesses to engage customers more deeply than ever before. 

The largest benefit of using customer engagement tools is automating a significant portion of the customer journey so businesses can find new ways to support, surprise, and delight their customers. 

##  Examples of customer engagement 

Customer engagement means optimizing interactions throughout the customer lifecycle to create better experiences, strengthen relationships, and generate more business. 

Here are some examples of how a customer engagement platform allows you to improve the customer experience. 

###  How L.G.R. World grew sales with customer engagement 

[ L.G.R. World ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customers/lgr-world) , a premium eyewear company, knew that not all of its customers had the same needs and interests. Engaging with them as if they were all the same was leaving money on the table. Revamping its customer engagement strategy increased ecommerce revenue by 143% and boosted transactions by 126%. 

To better serve customers, L.G.R. World evaluated various touchpoints in the buyer journey (tracked with ActiveCampaign) and used them to segment audiences and create personalized emails, web experiences, and social media interactions. 

![A picture of a man and woman, each with descriptors listed beneath them](https://www.activecampaign.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/L.G.R.-World-segmentation-example.png) Segmentation example from L.G.R. World ( [ Image Source ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customers/lgr-world) ) 

Using ActiveCampaign as its customer engagement platform, L.G.R. World could automate the segmentation process and personalized content delivery. By improving customer engagement through email, web personalization, and social media, the brand increased transactions and ecommerce revenue. 

###  How Hipcooks increased retention with customer engagement 

[ Hipcooks ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customers/hipcooks) is a cooking school where regular people can connect with their inner chef. Its brick-and-mortar cooking schools in cities along the West Coast allow people to learn alongside others from their community. When Hipcooks began using personalized messages based on customers’ geographic location, it led to higher customer retention rates (70%). 

![A screenshot of an email opt-in form with a list of cities](https://www.activecampaign.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Email-opt-in-example.png) Example of an email opt-in form with a list of cities ( [ Image Source ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customers/hipcooks) ) 

Thanks to ActiveCampaign’s customer engagement platform, Hipcooks could quickly pivot to marketing its virtual events when COVID-19 made in-person classes impossible. The right customer engagement platform makes it easier to communicate with customers when you’re working with unexpected challenges. 

##  How to choose a customer engagement platform 

Because engagement can mean so many things, it’s easy to get overwhelmed when choosing a platform. Here are 3 important factors to focus on as you consider different customer engagement tools. 

###  Features 

The 4 pillars to creating an incredible customer experience are: 

  * **Automation:** Execute your marketing strategy continuously with technology. 
  * **Segmentation:** Track and coordinate the information you have on your customers to customize their experience. 
  * **Personalization:** Create a unique experience for every single customer. 
  * **Orchestration:** Create a more connected customer experience by bringing together data from multiple platforms. 



As you review platform features, ask how they will enable you to build these pillars into your customer experience. For example, how do the features help you personalize different parts of the customer experience? Top customer engagement platforms allow for messaging across [ multiple marketing channels ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/multi-channel-marketing-strategy) , such as live chat, SMS, and social media. 

Additionally, by allowing customers to self-serve, the best engagement platforms enable customers to get answers to their questions faster. This reduces your time on the phone or in your inbox, supporting repetitive issues. 

###  Analytics and tracking 

If you want to improve your customer engagement, you need a platform that allows you to measure your performance accurately. 

Your customer engagement software should offer: 

  * Real-time analytics and dashboards 
  * Customer engagement tracking across digital channels 
  * Insights to help you make data-informed decisions 



Look for a customer engagement platform that unifies all of your customer data, giving your team a 360-degree view of the user. 

###  Scalability 

If all goes according to plan, your business will only grow in the coming years. That’s why it’s important to consider how a platform will serve you now and in the future. 

Ask yourself: will this platform meet my needs as my business grows? And does it remain affordable and effective with larger customer bases?

Customer engagement is an important part of the sales process and the post-sales relationship. Interactions across email, your website, and other channels build trust and improve the overall customer experience. 

Whether you’re first connecting with a new contact, nurturing a lead, or following up on a customer service request, how you engage with customers affects your ability to close and retain business. 

###  What is a customer engagement model? 

A customer engagement model is a brand’s approach to building and nurturing customer relationships. Companies might develop different customer engagement models for different customer journey stages. For example, you might have a different strategy for engaging cold leads than retaining and upselling an existing customer. 

###  How does a customer engagement platform differ from a CRM? 

While a customer engagement platform and a customer relationship management system ( [ CRM ](https://www.activecampaign.com/sales-crm) ) have much in common, they’re not the same. A CRM’s primary purpose is to collect and store information about your contacts (both leads and customers). It allows your sales, marketing, and customer service teams to share details about the relationship. 

A customer engagement platform is a tool that enables you to interact with and engage with customers. That means it might have features that allow you to segment your audience, implement personalization, and create marketing workflows. 

That being said, many platforms are blurring the lines between a CRM and a customer engagement platform, offering features of both tools. 

##  Cultivate and automate customer engagement 

A business can create deep emotional connections with customers by engaging with them on the channels they like most. New opportunities emerge every day to find new customers and earn repeat business from current customers. 

Choosing the right customer engagement platform for your business can help you reach more people, provide better customer experiences, and retain more customers for the long haul. When you add automation to this, you can amplify the efforts of even a small team.
