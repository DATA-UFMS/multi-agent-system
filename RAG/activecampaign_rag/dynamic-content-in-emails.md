[ Email marketing ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/email-marketing) may not be dead, but nobody can deny it’s become a saturated medium. 

Consumers get messages from their favorite brands every day, and their inboxes are flooded. Recipients can easily ignore your emails, resulting in poor open rates and a less-than-desirable return on investment. 

Today’s buyers want [ personalization ](https://www.activecampaign.com/email-marketing/list-segmentation) , but that introduces a challenging dichotomy for ambitious brands looking to serve that desire: 

How can we personalize emails while still working at scale? 

The answer: dynamic email. 

In this article, you’ll learn how dynamic email content can help you bridge the gap between high-volume email marketing and personalized customer communications. 

##  What is dynamic email? 

Dynamic content in email marketing describes any email content that changes based on the subscribers’ data, preferences, and behaviors. 

So, you’d send out a marketing email to your entire database, but certain content modules within that email would be dynamic, changing based on a characteristic you determine. 

Let’s say your company is an online shoe retailer, and you’re launching a Cyber Monday sale. 

You prepare the copy and creative around the campaign, all of which are the same for each recipient. What changes are the specific products recommended (that’s the dynamic part). 

The simplest example would be to segment by gender: men receive recommendations for male footwear, and vice versa. 

With dynamic content, you can personalize specific aspects of an email—text, visuals, or calls to action—to target particular subscribers and increase engagement. 

##  What are the benefits of dynamic email content? 

Dynamic email content adds value to your [ email marketing strategy ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/email-marketing-strategy) by ensuring your contacts see the information they need. 

With more relevant content, you can increase the effectiveness of your email campaigns. Here are 3 benefits of dynamic email content: 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_benefits-of-dynamic-email-content.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061947&s=005021a5eb2366f5689049e75ff4541d) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_benefits-of-dynamic-email-content.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061947&s=005021a5eb2366f5689049e75ff4541d)

The benefits of dynamic email content 

###  1\. Improve the customer experience 

[ Customer experience statistics ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics) show that you need to put your customers first. Dynamic content offers an opportunity to cater to each customer. You can personalize email content to reflect a subscriber’s geographical location, interests, and purchasing history. 

###  2\. Save your team time 

Dynamic email content helps your team create personalized experiences at scale. No more crafting separate campaigns for different [ audience segments ](https://www.activecampaign.com/platform/segmentation) . 

Instead of creating a different email to talk to your leads, customers, and advocates, you can develop 1 email and switch the content based on the specific segment. This level of automation frees up your time to focus on email strategy, not repetitive tasks. 

###  3\. Increase campaign engagement 

Your customers prefer to interact with content that speaks directly to them. With relevant content in your subscribers’ inboxes, they are more likely to open the messages and take action. More engagement for your brand means more opportunities to nurture relationships and sell products. 

##  What are the different types of dynamic email content? 

Dynamic email content is unique because you can make specific brand recommendations to your audience. You can point new leads to a [ landing page ](https://www.activecampaign.com/omnichannel/landing-pages) to purchase your product while directing your brand advocates to an upsell offer with a one-time coupon code. 

###  1\. Text 

Marketers using dynamic email content for the first time usually start with text (aka copy). It’s a simple but effective way to personalize your message to different subscribers. 

There are a few ways we can take advantage of dynamic copy: 

  * [ Email subject lines ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/email-subject-lines-improve-clicks)
  * Email body copy 
  * [ Calls to action ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/types-of-ctas-for-websites)



Even something as simple as using the recipient’s name in communications could be considered dynamic content, like this example: 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_dynamic-email-copy.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=95eb8d8f20bd2b977fd1c1c958108408) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_dynamic-email-copy.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=95eb8d8f20bd2b977fd1c1c958108408)

How dynamic email copy might look ( [ Image Source ](https://instapage.com/blog/dynamic-content-email-personalization) ) 

###  2\. Visuals 

Most of your emails are likely to include some kind of visual component. You’ll add images, illustrations, videos, product recommendations, and maybe even GIFs. 

Not all of your visual components will resonate with each customer, and this is particularly true for product recommendations by ecommerce brands. 

Take this marketing email from ASOS. 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_dynamic-email-image.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=ffd3f6b5f4d9dd6d9272e65a5645ea95) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_dynamic-email-image.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=ffd3f6b5f4d9dd6d9272e65a5645ea95)

Example of a dynamic email image ( [ Image Source ](https://econsultancy.com/asos-sales-emails-are-excellent-but-are-they-too-frequent/) ) 

A great example of dynamic visual content would be to use a different image based on the customer’s gender preferences. 

###  3\. Calls to action 

The purpose of a call-to-action (CTA) button or link is to grab your subscribers’ attention and encourage them to take action. Customizing CTAs helps boost your click-through rate—leading to more sales for your brand. 

Many times, CTA’s are a combination of the 2 previously mentioned elements: copy and visuals. 

You can play with the copy in the CTA based on buyer characteristics, but you can also experiment with design elements like colors and placement. 

##  How dynamic email content works 

Creating great dynamic email content means going above and beyond for your subscribers. [ Customer experience expectations ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-experience-expectations) are already high, so your team must find new ways to delight your audience. 

The answer: delivering personalized content to your customers. 

###  Step 1: Collect Data 

In order to personalize your email marketing with dynamic email content, you will need access to customer data. You can collect better customer data in 3 ways: 

  1. **Customer interviews** : Speak directly to your customers about the outcomes they’d want from using your product or service. 
  2. **Customer feedback** : Give your customers other ways to interact with you, such as [ email marketing data ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/email-marketing-benchmarks) (opens, clicks), your sales CRM, surveys, quizzes, and website live chat. 
  3. **Community research** : Aggregate review data from s [ ocial listening tools ](https://thecmo.com/tools/best-social-listening-tools/) and major platforms and look up important keywords on social media platforms. 



Learn more: Read our guide to identifying the [ needs of your customers ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-needs) . 

###  Step 2: Segmentation 

Customer segmentation plays a key part in personalizing your dynamic email content. Your goal is to [ group subscribers ](https://www.activecampaign.com/learn/guides/a-beginners-guide-to-lists) in a way that will increase your email engagement. 

Using the [ customer lifecycle ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-lifecycle) is beneficial when determining your customer segments. The customer lifecycle describes the stages consumers enter when they consider, purchase, and remain loyal customers of your product. It shows you how to engage with customers in the [ buyer’s journey ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/buyers-journey) . 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_customer-lifecycle.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=489d76d7d2c37b7652205af807583629) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_customer-lifecycle.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=489d76d7d2c37b7652205af807583629)

ActiveCampaign’s customer lifecycle 

You can create customer segments that match the customer lifecycle. Here are some recommendations for your business: 

  * **Reach & Engage: ** Focus on new visitors to your website. They may land on your site from a Google search, Facebook ad, or a mention from an influencer. 
  * **Nurture & Educate: ** Group new leads interested in your brand. These consumers want to learn how your product can address their specific needs. 
  * **Convert & Close: ** Seal the deal with eager consumers. You can send them personalized calls to action to get them to the checkout cart. 
  * **Support & Grow: ** Transform customers into brand advocates. You can delight each customer by emailing relevant product announcements and offers. 



###  Step 3: Customize dynamic email messages for each segment 

After selecting your customer segments, the next step is to decide how you will customize the email. There are limitless ways to target your subscribers with personalized content. 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_dynamic-email-segmentation.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=45b4c7627a8aede9968b41aefa67881b) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_dynamic-email-segmentation.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061948&s=45b4c7627a8aede9968b41aefa67881b)

Dynamic email segmentation 

Consider the following 4 customization options: 

####  1\. Demographics 

Using basic demographics is 1 of the easiest ways to customize your messaging. Here are a few examples of customer demographic information: 

  * Age 
  * Gender 
  * Geographical location 
  * Marital status 
  * Education level 
  * Professional occupation 



####  2\. Psychographics 

Psychographics targets a customer based on their beliefs, values, and interests. Depending on your business type, you may customize your message to fit their political views, hobbies, or food choices. You can collect this type of data through email surveys, website quizzes, or customer interviews. 

####  3\. Subscriber preferences 

Your customers know what they want to see from your brand. So, ask them directly to choose the type of content they would like to receive. 

You can give subscribers an option to express their preferences when signing up for your newsletter. Or you can include a link to a preference center at the bottom of your emails. 

####  4\. Behavioral data 

Behavioral data looks at specific patterns made by a customer’s actual actions. You can customize an email to fit a subscriber’s past purchasing history, website activity, or email engagement. Understanding customer behaviors is an opportunity to recreate more positive brand actions. 

##  How to add dynamic content to emails 

Today, many customers want a highly personalized shopping experience with product recommendations, special offers, and custom services. You can nurture brand relationships and outshine your competitors with dynamic email content. [ Macy Storm ](https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/6-tips-creating-dynamic-email-content/) , a content writer at WebFX, agrees: 

“Dynamic email content will help your business get more from your email marketing campaigns. You’ll create more tailored content that helps you earn conversions for your business.” 

In ActiveCampaign, you can [ create dynamic email content ](https://www.activecampaign.com/platform/dynamic-content) within the [ email designer ](https://www.activecampaign.com/platform/email-designer) . Hover over any content block to display a gear button, then select “Make conditional” to begin. 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_activecampaign-dynamic-email-formatting.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061947&s=9e7fa4aca444f147b0e501d6ba4e8b3a) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_activecampaign-dynamic-email-formatting.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061947&s=9e7fa4aca444f147b0e501d6ba4e8b3a)

Dynamic email formatting in ActiveCampaign 

Then, you will see a [ Conditional Content modal window ](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/220358207-How-to-use-Conditional-Content-in-emails) . You can create multiple conditions to determine with whom to share this specific content. For instance, you can display content to subscribers in a particular country. Or you might show content based on a specific tag.

How conditional content blocks work in ActiveCampaign 

After setting your conditions, you can hover over your content block to see a pop-up stating the conditions set. 

![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_activecampaign-dynamic-email-formatting-with-red-box.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061947&s=0e05acbb82d25157050258f40e89f221) ![](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_04_activecampaign-dynamic-email-formatting-with-red-box.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1732061947&s=0e05acbb82d25157050258f40e89f221)

Hover over conditional content block to see when it will trigger 

One content block can have multiple conditions for your subscribers to meet. Also, you can decide if your content will appear if all or any of the set conditions are met. 

##  Common mistakes when using dynamic email content 

Like any [ marketing campaig ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/marketing-campaign) n, dynamic email content is less effective when implemented without a strategy. Work with your team to create baseline rules before using dynamic content in email marketing. Below are a few common mistakes. 

###  Using inaccurate data 

Dynamic email content works best when you have accurate data about your subscribers. You don’t want to make the mistake of sending dog-related pet toys to a cat owner. So, your team should do an audit of your customer data. You also can ask subscribers to update their email preferences. 

###  Implementing multiple dynamic content types at once 

With any new tool, you’ll want to resist the urge to try every feature at the same time. Teams make the mistake of changing every single content block in an email. Instead, you’ll want to focus on what content needs personalization based on the customer segment. Aim to change only 1 or 2 content blocks per email. 

###  Failing to track metrics 

Your campaigns must be measured to track the progress of your dynamic email content. You’ll want to analyze the click-through rates of different content blocks. That way, your team better understands your subscriber’s activities and interests.

##  How to combine dynamic email content with email automation 

Dynamic email content and automation are powerful duos to deliver relevant content to your audience within an automated customer journey. Not only will your subscribers get personalized messages, but they also will receive your message at the right time within the [ lifecycle ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/customer-lifecycle) . 

Using dynamic email content in your [ welcome series ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/welcome-email-series) is a good starting point. Instead of delivering a generic welcome message to every subscriber that joins your newsletter, you can add customized content based on where they subscribed. 

If they signed up after attending your latest webinar, you could include content from your presentation. Or, if they subscribed while on a specific product page, you can add more details about the product in the welcome message. 

You can also replicate this same technique for your promotional, post-purchase, and [ re-engagement email ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/re-engagement-email) series. ActiveCampaign makes it even easier with [ automation recipes ](https://www.activecampaign.com/marketplace/) . These are pre-built automation templates that you can import into your ActiveCampaign account.
