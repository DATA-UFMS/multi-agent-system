#  Email Campaign 

###  Definition 

An email campaign is a series of emails sent to subscribers for a specific purpose. 

##  How does an email campaign work? 

Email campaigns typically involve segmenting an audience, crafting personalized content, and automating delivery through an email marketing platform. Performance is tracked using metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and conversions to refine future campaigns. Effective email marketing campaigns focus on relevance, timing, and clear calls to action to maximize impact. 

##  How do I start an email campaign? 

Start by focusing on your email list. Use segmentation and personalization to make every single email feel personal. Once you've segmented your list and personalized your email campaign, you're on your way to a successful email campaign.

  * [ Using AI to kickstart your email marketing ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/ai-email-marketing)
  * [ 9 steps to a high-performing email marketing strategy ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/email-marketing-strategy)



##  How long should an email campaign be? 

Since most email campaigns are a single email or a short series of emails, within each email, the answer depends on what your contacts have signed up to receive from you. If it's a newsletter, emails up to 1,000+ words are not uncommon. But, if the emails are focused on e-commerce and the goal is to get the contact to make a purchase, a copy length between 50-100 words can be effective. 

##  How do you write a successful email campaign? 

  * Customize the sender "from" name so the contact remembers who is sending it to them 
  * Customize the recipient "to" name 
  * Craft a benefit-focused subject line and [ pre-header ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/email-preheader) text. 
  * Write body copy that is compelling and expected by the recipient 
  * Focus on writing emails that get opens and elicit action (avoiding email inbox filters) 



##  How do I create an email campaign? 

  * Build an [ email list ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/email-list) of interested contacts 
  * Define the goals of your email campaign 
  * Segment your email list based on contact information 
  * Personalize your emails 
  * Write relevant and valuable emails 
  * Write a subject line that encourages contacts to open 



##  What is an example of an email campaign? 

An email campaign can look very different depending on your goal. 

**For instance:**

  * [ **Welcome series:** ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/welcome-email-series) Introduces new subscribers to your brand’s story, products, or services. Often sent in a short series, it helps build immediate rapport and sets expectations for future emails. 
  * [ **Abandoned cart reminder:** ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/abandoned-cart-emails) **** Targets customers who added items to their cart but left without purchasing. A well-timed reminder (often with a small incentive) can nudge them back to checkout. 
  * [ **Product launch announcement:** ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/announcement-email) **** Generates excitement around a new product or feature. Including vibrant visuals, key benefits, and clear CTAs can prompt immediate curiosity and early sales. 
  * [ **Win-back campaign:** ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/win-back-email-campaigns) **** Re-engages contacts who haven’t opened or clicked in a while, often with a special offer or compelling reason to return. These campaigns remind subscribers of the value you provide—and can rekindle dormant relationships. 



##  Drive more conversions with automated, personalized emails 

Make every send count by tailoring your campaigns to individual subscribers—without adding hours of extra work. With ActiveCampaign’s easy segmentation and automation tools, you can turn more “opens” into meaningful actions.

##  Email campaign FAQs 

Looking to get started or take your campaigns to the next level? Here are quick answers to common questions about email campaign strategy and execution. 

###  What are the most popular types of email marketing campaigns? 

Some of the most common include welcome series, newsletters, promotional offers, abandoned cart reminders, and re-engagement campaigns. Each serves a distinct purpose, from nurturing new subscribers to converting lapsed customers. 

###  How much time does it take to implement an email marketing tool? 

It depends on factors like your team’s technical expertise and the complexity of your needs. 

Simple setups (like basic signup forms and one or two welcome emails) can go live in a few hours, whereas advanced automations with segmentation and multi-step workflows may take several days (or more) to configure and test properly. 

###  What is a successful open rate for an email campaign? 

Most industries see an average open rate ranging from 15% to 25%. However, “success” truly depends on your niche, list quality, and email content. Always benchmark against your own past performance and run A/B tests to see how changes in subject lines, send times, or segmentation affect open rates. 

###  ​​How can I avoid spam filters? 

Use a reputable email service provider, avoid spammy keywords (like “FREE!!!”), and keep your list clean by removing inactive or invalid emails. Always include a visible unsubscribe link and comply with laws such as CAN-SPAM and GDPR where applicable. Regularly monitor deliverability reports to ensure your campaigns reach inboxes.
