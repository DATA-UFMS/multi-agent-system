8,000. 

That’s how many marketing tech (or ‘MarTech’) companies exist. 

Talk about a crowded space. 

In 2017, there were 5,000 MarTech tools, for which Scott Brinker created his famous [ Marketing 5,000 ](https://chiefmartec.com/2017/05/marketing-techniology-landscape-supergraphic-2017/) graphic. The recent version shows how an additional 3,000 competitors have only made the tidal wave of tools more overwhelming. 

![An illustration of 8,000 marketing technology tools, categorized by function](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_Marketing-technology-landscape-graphic.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931089&s=831a62684d96b92c9bd207ec6469f8d2) ![An illustration of 8,000 marketing technology tools, categorized by function](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_Marketing-technology-landscape-graphic.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931089&s=831a62684d96b92c9bd207ec6469f8d2)

8000 MarTech tools are a lot to sort through. ( [ Source ](https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/) ) 

And all of these 8,000+ tools want to be a part of your MarTech stack. It’s up to you to pick the best ones. No pressure; it will only affect how well your business does. 

Nervous? Don’t be. This post will give you a handy roadmap to navigate the vast marketing technology landscape. 

The good news is that you already have a MarTech stack. It’s all the tools you use to manage clients, send emails, and efficiently collaborate across company departments. 

But if you want to get better results, it pays to ask yourself a few questions: 

  * How do all my tools work together? 
  * Are there tools with which I could get better results? 
  * Am I using all the features of tools I already have? 



If you haven’t thought about this, it’s time to get serious about building your marketing technology stack. This post will teach you what a MarTech stack is, how to build your MarTech stack, and which tools you should consider.

##  What is a MarTech stack? 

A MarTech stack, also known as a marketing stack, is the group of technology-based tools you use to execute and improve marketing across multiple customer channels. A MarTech stack creates efficient internal collaboration and better customer communication. 

Why do you need a MarTech stack? Because the process of attracting, acquiring, and retaining customers involves many steps and many channels. 

No 1 tool can (effectively) manage your email, social media, content publication, SEO, and more. You need multiple tools to execute modern digital marketing, and together, they make up your MarTech stack. 

For all you comic book fans, you can think of your MarTech stack as The Avengers. Each tool is a superhero bringing their specific skills to the table. When you combine these pieces, they form a team that can handle almost any obstacle. 

![Puzzle pieces of different marketing tools fit together](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_Marketing-tools-work-together-in-a-martech-stack.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931089&s=41d41131f824d037e67e20fe584a10e8) ![Puzzle pieces of different marketing tools fit together](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_Marketing-tools-work-together-in-a-martech-stack.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931089&s=41d41131f824d037e67e20fe584a10e8)

Putting together a MarTech stack is like a puzzle 

Although budgets took a hit during the pandemic, marketing budgets [ grew to 9.5% ](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/marketing/documents/marketing_budgets_2022_research.pdf) of company revenue in 2022, with most of that spending going to digital channels. Businesses in all industries see the value in marketing technology and are looking to innovate. 

Since each business will have different goals and challenges, your MarTech stack will consist of a unique mix of the tools that best fit your needs. 

Some of the most common components of a typical MarTech stack are: 

  * An email marketing and automation platform like ActiveCampaign 
  * A social media scheduling tool like Sprout Social or Buffer 
  * A content management system (CMS) that hosts a company blog like WordPress or Ghost 
  * Analytics tools to track the success of marketing efforts like Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics 
  * [ CRM email marketing software ](https://www.activecampaign.com/platform/email-marketing) like ActiveCampaign 



###  Does your company need a MarTech stack? 

Absolutely. 

Building a MarTech stack isn’t easy, but it can help you coordinate your marketing campaigns, deliver [ personalized experiences ](https://www.activecampaign.com/learn/guides/creating-personalized-experiences-with-predictive-content) across the customer journey, and transform your data into actionable insights. 

That’s not all. Investing in a MarTech stack also allows you to leverage automation, freeing up your marketing team to focus on higher-value work. 

For example, consider [ drip campaigns ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/drip-campaigns) —a series of emails you send to prospects or customers over time. 

Without the right MarTech tool, you’d have to manually send each email to your entire list. It’s doable but incredibly tedious and time-consuming. 

You can automate your drip campaigns and even create sequences to aid your lead generation efforts by adding email marketing software to your marketing stack. 

So, are marketers seeing measurable results from their marketing stack? Yes. 

![Pie chart labeled with 95%](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_95-of-marketers-consider-their-martech-stack-successful.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931089&s=353c12cf7f79ea87f7f10951f91ba397) ![Pie chart labeled with 95%](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_95-of-marketers-consider-their-martech-stack-successful.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931089&s=353c12cf7f79ea87f7f10951f91ba397)

95% of marketers consider their martech stack successful 

As much as [ 95% ](https://ascend2.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ascend2-MarTech-Stack-Optimization-Survey-Summary-Report-200122.pdf) of marketers describe their MarTech stack strategy as somewhat or very successful at achieving key priorities. 

You need MarTech tools, no question. So what types of tools should go into a MarTech stack? 

##  What is included in a MarTech stack? 

There’s no single best approach for building a MarTech stack. An effective stack, however, typically includes tools for the following: 

###  Customer relationship management (CRM) 

CRM software is simply a must for any MarTech stack. It allows you to manage your customer data across different platforms from 1 central location. 

CRM software with built-in [ lead scoring ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/lead-scoring-101) capabilities also enables your sales team to focus their efforts on qualified leads that are more likely to convert. 

###  Social media 

Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter enable companies to raise brand awareness and connect with audiences. Social media tools allow you to schedule posts, monitor mentions, measure engagement, and more. 

You can also plan ahead with ActiveCampaign's [ **free** **social media calendar template** ](https://www.activecampaign.com/free-marketing-tools/social-media-calendar-template) ! 

###  Search engine optimization (SEO) 

[ SEO ](https://www.activecampaign.com/glossary/search-engine-optimization) is a marketing strategy companies use to drive organic traffic to their websites by ranking on search engines like Google. 

Many SEO tools allow you to conduct keyword research, track search engine rankings, conduct technical audits, and more. 

###  Content management system (CMS) 

A CMS is an essential tool that lets you efficiently manage and organize content without requiring any technical knowledge. Some companies use popular CMS platforms like WordPress, while others may opt for a more bespoke solution. 

###  Advertising technology 

More companies are investing in paid search and social ads to reach their audiences. Google, Facebook, and Amazon alone account for [ 64% ](https://www.emarketer.com/content/google-facebook-amazon-account-over-70-of-us-digital-ad-spending) of digital ad spend in the U.S. 

Advertising tools help you manage and automate aspects of your marketing campaigns. They also track key metrics in real-time so you can adjust your strategy accordingly. 

###  Marketing automation

###  Email marketing 

Email marketing software not only helps you manage your list and create personalized campaigns but also shows you who engages with your emails. You can also build automation into your campaigns to drive more sales. 

###  Analytics and reporting 

No MarTech stack is complete without an analytics tool. You need the right data to measure the effectiveness of your campaigns so you know what works and what doesn’t. 

Companies typically use website analytics and other tracking tools to gather insights into their marketing efforts. 

###  QR Codes 

QR codes are a versatile addition to a marketing software stack, facilitating seamless connections between physical and digital marketing channels. They enable lead generation through printed materials, provide valuable data for personalized campaigns, and enhance user experiences by delivering relevant content and promotions. When integrated into a broader marketing strategy, QR codes play a pivotal role in optimizing engagement and tracking user interactions across various touchpoints. 

##  How to build a MarTech stack 

Putting together an effective MarTech stack is by no means easy. But it can mean the difference between hitting your marketing goals or falling short. 

Follow these steps to build a MarTech stack that supports your marketing objectives. 

###  1\. Assess your marketing requirements 

To choose the best technologies for your MarTech stack, you should begin with your marketing goals and areas of opportunity. Assess your team’s particular needs to identify which [ tools to add to your MarTech stack ](https://omnizant.com/ai-tools-to-consider-adding-to-your-martech-stack/) . What are your marketing objectives? What specific problems are you trying to solve? 

Let’s say you want a better system to convert more leads. Investing in [ a tool with lead scoring capabilities ](https://www.activecampaign.com/platform/lead-scoring) will help your sales team find more qualified leads. 

Understanding your requirements will help you avoid wasting resources on solutions your company may not even need. 

###  2\. Analyze the tools you already use 

Building a MarTech stack doesn’t mean you have to start from scratch. Gartner found that, on average, companies only use [ 58% ](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/marketing/documents/marketing_technology_survey_research_2020.pdf) of their MarTech stack’s full capabilities. Look at your company's existing tools and ask what they are doing well (and where they’re falling short). 

Do these tools include extra features you’re not using? Are there any upgrades you can add to your plan to fill any “gaps” in your marketing? It’s simpler and more cost-effective to make the most of the tools you already have than to look for another vendor for every little task. 

For example, ActiveCampaign customers can add [ Conversations ](https://www.activecampaign.com/customer-messaging/conversations) to their existing plans to speak with their visitors in real-time via live chat. 

![Online chat windows with customer and business](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_ActiveCampaign-users-can-add-Conversations-to-their-plan.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931090&s=643c1a0b2b8ede991599a677fbc525e4) ![Online chat windows with customer and business](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_ActiveCampaign-users-can-add-Conversations-to-their-plan.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931090&s=643c1a0b2b8ede991599a677fbc525e4)

Online chat windows with customer and business 

Ultimately, you want to provide your teams with the tech stack they need to streamline their workflows. Less time spent on mundane tasks means more time for higher-value work. 

Survey your team to identify what challenges they’re facing. What tasks do they spend the most time on? What steps in their workflow are they performing manually? 

Use the responses you receive to find the right MarTech solution. 

For example, if your team spends too much time checking in with prospects, investing in a tool that [ automates email follow-ups ](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/7-steps-to-create-your-best-automated-follow-up-sequence) can streamline this process. 

###  4\. Establish a marketing budget 

Assessing your marketing requirements and surveying your team will help you identify gaps in your MarTech stack. But you must set aside enough funds to afford the necessary tools. 

You can either establish a budget for specific tools (e.g., $500 a month for SEO tools) or choose a budget for the entire team on a recurring basis. 

How much should you set aside? 

![Pie chart with 26.2% segment highlighted](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_Companies-devote-26.2-of-their-marketing-budgets-to-technology.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931090&s=5f530e5952b00eeb4c3e04ee50472c4d) ![Pie chart with 26.2% segment highlighted](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_Companies-devote-26.2-of-their-marketing-budgets-to-technology.png?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931090&s=5f530e5952b00eeb4c3e04ee50472c4d)

Average MarTech budget 

That’ll depend on factors like your company size and the tools you’re investing in. According to Gartner, companies spend [ 26.2% ](https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/gartner-cmo-2020-2021-tech-digital-channels-withstand-budget-cuts) of their marketing budget on technology. 

###  5\. Research different vendors 

It’s important to research your options when choosing a marketing tool. However, this isn’t easy, considering the sheer number of vendors. 

Complicating matters further is when MarTech solutions have confusing offers. 70% of Chief Marketing Officers say that vendors don’t provide enough information to make an informed decision. 

Make a list of the different tools and compare the features that each offers. The objective here is to determine which ones meet your marketing needs. 

Reading reviews can also help you learn more about a specific tool. But it’d be even better to sign up for a free trial if there’s 1 available. This will give you a better sense of how a MarTech solution fits into your workflows. 

###  6\. Implement and evaluate 

Evaluate the new tool and get feedback from the team. Does it make their job easier? Does it complement their workflows? 

If a new marketing tool doesn’t work out, don’t hesitate to cancel your subscription and switch to another solution. The last thing you want is to have unused tools in your stack. 

And if you do decide to stick with a specific tool, work with your I.T. team to integrate it with the tools your company already uses. Continuously measure how the tools in your stack are performing and make changes as needed. 

The next question is, “what are the right tech tools?” 

##  The 11 best MarTech tools to build your marketing tech stack

##  How businesses like yours use marketing stacks successfully—and help others make their own 

“New technology can be scary, and you don’t want to struggle with a tool that has a steep learning curve. Unfortunately, this means companies are missing out on some great products that can make life and business so much easier,” - [ Travis Wright ](https://www.inc.com/travis-wright/your-ultimate-cheat-sheet-to-marketing-technology-martech.html) , Chief Marketing Technologist at CCP Global

###  Earth Networks Marketing Tech Stack 

Earth Networks, a meteorological data and weather intelligence company, has a top-tier marketing stack—and it’s clever (they won the award for “best brand metaphor” with their marketing stack in the [ 2018 Stackies ](https://chiefmartec.com/2018/04/54-marketing-stacks-stackies-2018-marketing-tech-stack-awards/) ). 

Their stack-as-a-weather-system graphic shows a solid, efficient (and pretty advanced) structure: 

![image of marketological forecasting stack by earth networks](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_marketological-forecasting-stack-image.jpg?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931091&s=53463e90815717552df22cf6ce854fbd) ![image of marketological forecasting stack by earth networks](https://active-campaign.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/general/wp/2021_01_marketological-forecasting-stack-image.jpg?w=1600&q=80&auto=format&fit=clip&dm=1731931091&s=53463e90815717552df22cf6ce854fbd)

Color coding of tools categorizes each 1 by capability: content creation (blue), distribution (orange), customer experience (green), website (yellow), and data management (magenta) 

What you see here is: 

  * Opportunity and revenue are both “highs.” 
  * Churn is a “low.” 
  * The whole thing is called a “marketological forecasting stack.” 
  * A “jet stream” of core platforms runs throughout the entire marketing process. 
  * Three “fronts” of marketing efforts and the function of tools in each: attract, engage, and analyze. 



The stack covers specific areas of need—content creation and data management—with multiple tools. 

Note: If this marketing stack looks intimidating, don’t worry! This is an advanced marketing stack; you can use something simpler to start.
