##  Frequently Asked Questions 

  * ###  What is a CRM database? 

A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) database is the collection of every single one of the contacts your business has obtained. Its purpose is to make sure you and your team are aware of where your customers are in the marketing funnel and what you need to do next to convert them. It’s a very important tool to utilize to use the full power of marketing automation. 

  * ###  What role can an integrated CRM play in an effective MarTech stack? 

Within your marketing stack, a CRM effectively works as the brain. It’s where all your contact information is stored and lets the other aspects of your marketing stack (email marketing, social media, digital ads) know what to send and when to send content to your leads. 

  * ###  Why is it important that your ESP integrated with a CRM? 

If your email service provider and CRM aren’t integrated and communicating with each other, then you’re adding a lot of manual labor to your marketing. Instead of going back and forth between two different software to manually create email campaigns and sends, your CRM can do the heavy lifting for you so all you have to do is click send.
