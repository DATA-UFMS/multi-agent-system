#  Internal Link 

##  What is an Internal Link? 

An internal link is any hyperlink leading to the page or resource on the same website. Internal Links establish the website’s hierarchy and help users and search engine [ crawlers ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/crawler) navigate and discover new pages. 

For example, think of your website navigation. You have links to different pages on your site, like About Us, Shop, Blog, etc. These links are referred to as internal links since they connect two pages on the same domain. 

##  Why are internal links important? 

Internal Links are important because they allow users to navigate from one website page to another. Imagine how difficult it would be for users to explore different pages on your website without a menu or text links. 

Search engine crawlers, such as [ Googlebot ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/googlebot) , use internal links to discover new pages on websites. However, there are other sources for discovery. Google uses sitelinks and [ external incoming links ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/inbound-link) for that too. So a web page with no internal links (known as an [ orphan page ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/orphan-page) ) can be indexed and even rank well. However, internal links signal the page’s importance to Google, which can influence page rankings and recrawl frequency. 

Apart from helping users and crawlers navigate the website, internal links also pass [ PageRank (link equity) ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/pagerank) from one page to another. When Page A links to Page B, some PageRank gets passed to Page B, thus helping it rank higher on Search Engine Result Pages [SERP]. That is why internal links should not be neglected in your overall SEO strategy. 

For example, if you add a link to your new blog post from the home page of your blog, you’ll not only help users and crawlers find the post faster, but you will also pass some PageRank from a page with high authority to this newly created page. This can help boost its search engine rankings. 

Lastly, internal links help influence [ sitelinks ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/sitelinks) on SERPs. Have you seen the search results like this for a particular website? 

![Typical organic sitelinks on SERP](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Typical-organic-sitelinks-on-SERP.png)

Because Google understands your website pages better with the help of internal links, it can generate this SERP feature. This helps your site get more visibility and generate additional clicks on SERPs. 

##  Best practices for internal linking 

###  1\. Use descriptive anchor texts 

Google uses the [ anchor text ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/anchor-text) as a context signal to better understand the page you’re linking to. So using anchor texts like “top 10 cafes in NYC” will provide Google with more context about the page than some generic anchor text like “click here”. 

Anchor texts also have a significant impact on user experience. When users read content and come across a link, a descriptive anchor text will help them identify the context of the referenced page. 

###  2\. Don’t rely on navigation links alone 

Internal links can be classified into two categories: structural links and contextual links. Structural links include your website navigation, footer, headers, and sitemaps. These links generally remain consistent across all website pages (also known as sitewide links). 

Contextual links are links within a paragraph that contains similar ideas or trends. For instance, you have a post about the “10 best cafes in NYC”. You recently posted another article on “Things to do in NYC” with a paragraph that talks about the different cafes in the city. That paragraph is a perfect place to put a contextual link to the “10 best cafes” article. 

Although structural links will help users and crawlers navigate the site. Contextual links are usually more relevant and contribute to Google’s understanding of the linked page. 

###  3\. Be mild in using internal links 

In layman’s terms, the more outgoing links a page has, the less “ [ link juice ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/link-equity) ” each linked page gets. Keep this in mind if you want to use internal links to boost the PageRank scores of some particular pages. 

Besides, a “wall” of links is barely something your visitors want to see on your pages. 

###  4\. Audit your internal links regularly 

It’s a good practice to audit your internal links regularly. 

It will help you uncover if your website has any issues related to internal links, such as: 

  * Broken links 
  * Excessive links to redirecting URLs 
  * [ Nofollow ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/nofollow) internal links 



You will also be able to identify the orphan pages on your website that may be missing the potential from internal links. 

The easiest way to identify internal link issues is to use our [ Site Audit ](https://ahrefs.com/site-audit) tool: 

![Issues related to internal links in Ahrefs Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Issues-related-to-internal-links-in-Ahrefs-Site-Audit.png)

###  5\. Look for more internal link opportunities 

Finding internal link opportunities for your new and existing content must be a part of your overall SEO strategy. 

The easiest way to identify them is to make a “site:” search on Google with your target keyword. This will return all pages on your site that Google finds relevant to this topic, even if those pages don’t mention the keyword itself. 

Here’s an example:   
![Internal link opportunities in Google](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internal-link-opportunities-in-Google.jpg)

We got a list of relevant pages from which we could link to our article about [ gated content ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/gated-content) . 

This method, however, is time-consuming. 

The [ Internal Link Opportunities Report ](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-opportunities/) in the free [ Webmaster Tools ](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools) and [ Site Audit ](https://ahrefs.com/site-audit) will give you internal link suggestions on autopilot.
