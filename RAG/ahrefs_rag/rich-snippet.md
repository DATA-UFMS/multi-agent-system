#  Rich Snippet 

##  What is Rich Snippet? 

A rich snippet is visually expanded text snippet that appears beneath the regular search results on Google. It provides additional useful information extracted from the [ structured data ](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/structured-data) of a webpage. 

The specific structured data type determines the type of information displayed, such as ratings (for reviews), cooking time (for recipes), genre (for music), and more. 

Here are some examples of rich snippets: 

![Review - product - rich snippet](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Review-product-rich-snippet.png)

![rich snippet for events](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rich-snippet-for-events.png)

There appears to be some confusion regarding the term “rich snippet,” and the description provided above reflects our definition of rich snippets. It is worth noting that Google often uses the terms “rich snippet” and “rich results” [ interchangeably ](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7506797?hl=en) . 

However, when most SEOs discuss rich results, they are usually referring to more advanced outcomes that surpass the conventional Google listings. Here is an example: 

Therefore, it can be stated that rich snippets are one of the various types of rich results. 

##  Why are rich snippets important? 

Optimizing for rich snippets on your website allows your web pages to look more visually appealing on SERPs. Rich snippets can help your site stand out from your competitors, increasing click-through rates and your organic traffic. 

Rich snippets can also help your prospective users find information faster. 

For example, if we search “vegan kale salad recipes,” we can see the top organic result goes to a salad that only takes ten minutes to make. It also includes an ingredient list, instructions, substitutions, and storage info. Having this information available to your users may make them more likely to visit your site: 

![rich snippet - cooking time](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rich-snippeet-cooking-time.jpg)

Adding structured data to your webpage also helps Google better understand your page’s content. By making it easier for Google to understand your webpage, you increase your chances of being featured for voice searches. 

Voice searches are growing rapidly, and adding [ speakable structured data ](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/speakable) and rich snippets can be an easy way to attract more customers to your web page. 

##  How to get rich snippets for your pages? 

To add rich snippets to your web page, you should add relevant structured data. 

You can find the structured data that Google Search supports in the [ Google Search Central documentation ](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery) .
