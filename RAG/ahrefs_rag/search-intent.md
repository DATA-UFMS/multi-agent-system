#  Search Intent 

##  What is Search Intent? 

Search intent - also referred to as “user intent” - is a term that describes the goal and purpose of the user’s search query. In other words, it tells you why the user chose to type a particular query into the search engine - and what they hoped to achieve with that search. 

When users type something into Google’s search bar, they generally have a good reason for doing so - and their satisfaction with search results depends on how well Google understood the intent behind that query. 

In SEO, search intent is commonly divided into four types: 

  * **Informational** : As one of the most common search intents, informational intent refers to users looking for information. They typically need an answer to a specific question, want to learn how to solve a problem, or do in-depth research on a particular topic. 
  * **Navigational** : The second type of search intent involves users looking to visit a specific website - but are either unsure about the exact URL or find it easier to do a quick Google search. 
  * **Transactional** : Users will search with transactional intent when they’re ready to complete a specific action - more often than not, make a purchase. 
  * **Commercial investigation** : Some searchers may have the intention of buying a specific product or service - but haven’t made their final purchase decision yet. They’re looking to learn more and compare different products. 



##  Why is search intent important? 

Knowing which keywords to target is no longer enough for your pages to rank in SERPs. Google continuously works on improving content relevance, returning only the most relevant pages, and ensuring that the user finds exactly what they need. 

With roughly 8.5 billion daily Google searches - with an average length of three words per query - the search engine has to figure out exactly what the user wants, filter the available information, and display results based on that. 

And pages that fit not only the search term but the intent behind that specific query are the ones that will rank the highest in SERPs. 

In other words, meeting the search intent is one of Google’s primary goals: 

Google has been working hard on improving and fine-tuning the search algorithm to identify the intent behind a search query and show results accordingly. There is an entire section called “Understanding User Intent” in [ Google’s Quality Rater Guidelines ](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf) . 

That’s not to say that other ranking signals don’t matter; they most certainly do. Still, if your page fails to meet and satisfy search intent, it won’t rank well. Matching your content to the user intent should be viewed as a key part of your SEO strategy and the foundation of success. 

The better you comprehend search intent, the easier it becomes to: 

  * Perform more effective keyword research and target search phrases that align with your target audience’s needs. 
  * Create content that provides value and structure your pages in a “friendly” way for website visitors and search engines alike. 
  * Broaden your online reach and target people at different stages of the funnel. 
  * Improve your site’s ranking in SERPs by creating content that Google views as valuable, authoritative, and relevant to the users. 



##  How to determine search intent? 

Search intent is often easily identified based on how the user worded their query. You may not realize this, but there’s a considerable difference in what you’d type in the search bar when your intent is purely informational versus when it’s transactional. 

More often than not, people will word their search phrases in a way that reveals intent. 

Here’s an example: 

Let’s say the main keyword is “ _diamonds_ .” A search query that’s phrased as “ _buy diamonds_ ” has an entirely different user intent at its core than the one phrased as “ _how to clean diamonds_ .” The first shows an intention to purchase (transactional intent); the other is informational. 

[ Keywords Explorer ](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer) can help you uncover keywords that align with specific search intents by simply adding “modifiers” that would indicate the type of intent that’s most relevant to you. 

Even though search intent is often obvious enough, it’s still a good idea to check the SERPs and look at the pages that are already ranking for that particular keyword. Those pages have passed the algorithm’s “search intent test,” so they must be doing something right. 

On a related note, you should also look at the SERP features. 

If the intent of the search is informational, you’ll likely come across a featured snippet - but if the query is transactional, you’re more likely to see shopping results. 

##  How to optimize for search intent? 

###  1\. Check SERP for fluctuations 

One thing you must remember when relying on top-ranking pages to identify search intent is that rankings can fluctuate over a given timeframe. 

Suppose you see plenty of fluctuations among the top-ranking pages over a six-month period. In that case, it’s safe to assume that either Google doesn’t understand the actual intent behind the particular search query or that the intent is constantly changing. 

Either way, these pages aren’t representative of search intent. 

###  2\. Research the competition 

Before you create new content - or update your existing pages - you should take some time to see what your competitors are doing. 

They’re obviously doing something right SEO-wise - otherwise, they wouldn’t be ranking so high in SERPs. Look at how the pages are formatted, which points they cover in the content, their tone of voice - and, most importantly, what these pages are missing. 

That last bit could be your chance to outdo them in SERPs. 

###  3\. Use the “3 C’s of search intent” 

Content type, content format, and content angle are the so-called “3 C’s of search intent” that you can use to figure out the search intent and optimize your content accordingly. 

Here is a quick overview of each: 

  * **Content type** refers to the dominant type of content you will see in SERPs, such as blog posts, landing pages, or product pages. 
  * **Content format** refers to the actual format - tutorials, reviews, comparisons, or list posts, for example - of the top-ranking pages for the desired keyword. 
  * **Content angle** refers to the unique selling point highlighted by the top-ranking pages in SERPs and tells you more about what users value the most when they type in a specific search query. 



##  FAQs 

###  How many types of search intent are there? 

The four widely recognized types of search intent are Informational, Navigational, Transactional, and Commercial Investigation. More often than not, you can determine a user’s intent based on the exact keyword phrasing. 

###  What is a type of search? 

A search type is essentially the same as search intent and can be further split into three distinct groups - Informational, Navigational, Transactional, and Commercial Investigation.
