Our  [ 2023 B2B research ](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/b2b-research/7-things-b2b-content-marketers-need-in-2023-new-research) showed that only half (49%) of marketers surveyed feel their organization measures content performance accurately. The top challenge they face with measuring content performance is difficulty integrating/correlating data across multiple platforms (48%). 

But even for those who do track performance, there’s little consensus across the industry about which metrics to focus on. And with attribution changing (watch the video below to learn how and what to do about it), there's a lot to consider.
