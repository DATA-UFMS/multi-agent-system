Let's start with some common questions you may have. 

##  What exactly  is  content marketing? 

Content marketing is the strategic marketing approach of creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and acquire a clearly defined audience — with the objective of driving profitable customer action. 

In short, instead of pitching your products or services, you are delivering information that makes your buyer more intelligent. The essence of this content strategy is the belief that if we, as businesses, deliver consistent, ongoing valuable information to buyers, they ultimately reward us with their business and loyalty.

##  What are the basic principles, tactics, and terms? 

Like other forms of digital marketing, content marketing involves the strategic use of engaging, high-quality content. However, content marketers use content to serve the distinct purpose outlined above. Rather than replacing techniques like traditional marketing, public relations, or search engine optimization, content marketing is most effective when it's applied in tandem with them. 

Though content marketing shares many of the same tactics and terminology used in other marketing disciplines, they need to be viewed and applied through a different lens. To get a clear understanding of what those terms are – and where their distinctions lie – check out our  [ essential glossary of key content marketing terms ](/content-marketing-strategy/57-words-every-content-marketer-should-know-glossary) .
