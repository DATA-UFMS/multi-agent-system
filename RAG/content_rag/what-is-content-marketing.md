##  How does content marketing support the bottom line and customers' needs? 

Wouldn’t it be great if your customers looked forward to receiving your marketing? What if when they received it (whether through print, email, social channels, your blog, or website), they spent time engaging with it? What if they anticipated it and shared it with their peers?
