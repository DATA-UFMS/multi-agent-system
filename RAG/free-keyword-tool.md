###  Why use WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool for keyword research? 

Keyword research is one of the first – and most crucial – steps in any search marketing campaign, organic or paid. But most free keyword suggestion tools offer limited results and limited utility, especially when it comes to keyword research for PPC. 

To drive search engine traffic, whether through organic search or paid search advertisements, you need the right keywords, plus a process to expand your keyword lists over time. That’s where our free tool comes in. 

WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool gives you hundreds of relevant keyword results, plus additional, actionable information like competition level and estimated CPC, all for free! It’s an awesome alternative to Google’s Keyword Planner. 

###  How does the Free Keyword Tool work? 

Just enter a keyword and then choose your industry and country (if desired). You’ll get a list of related [ keyword suggestions, ](https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-suggestion) including long-tail keyword variations, as well as their search volume on Google and Bing. 

You can also enter a website URL – such as a competitor’s homepage – to get contextual keyword suggestions and ideas to help you compete against similar businesses. 

We’ll show you the top 25 keywords right away. To get the full list of keywords, just enter your email address, and we’ll send you the full keyword list by email for free. 

###  What are the Free Keyword Tool’s unique features? 

You don’t just want keywords – you want competitive, [ industry-specific information ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks) and keyword analysis features that help you prioritize and make the most of your marketing budget. 

Our free Bing and Google keyword tool is specifically designed to arm paid search marketers with better, more complete keyword information to inform their PPC campaigns, including competition and cost data, tailored to your country and industry, so you know your keyword list is super-relevant to your specific business. 

Once you’ve got your keyword list, download it as a CSV file to make it super-easy to upload directly into your Google Ads or Bing Ads account. Put your keywords to work! 

We think it’s one of the best keyword research tools out there for PPC marketers. But you can use it for SEO keyword research too! 

###  Keyword Data Sources for The Free Keyword Tool 

The Free Keyword Tool’s keyword and keyword search volume data is sourced through the Google and Bing keyword research API. 

###  Filtering Free Keyword Results by Industry 

With WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool you also have the option to filter your results by industry, which specifies your results and other data including search volume, competition level and estimated CPC so they’re all maximally relevant to your industry. 

For example, if you search for keywords related to “cars” while selecting “Arts & Entertainment” as the industry, you’ll see results like “cars movie,” “disney cars,” and “pixar cars.” However, if you input the same term and change the industry to “Finance & Banking,” you’ll see results like “new car incentives” and “new car lease.” 

You can filter your results by 24 business verticals, including Apparel, Arts & Entertainment, Autos & Vehicles, Beauty & Fitness, Books & Literature, Business & Industrial, Computers & Electronics, Finance & Banking, Food & Drink, Toys & Games, Health, Hobbies & Leisure, Home & Garden, Internet & Telecom, Jobs & Education, Law & Government, News Media & Publications, Family & Community, Occasions & Gifts, Pets & Animals, Real Estate, Retail & General Merchandise, Sports & Fitness, and Travel & Tourism.

###  The Top Alternative to Keyword Planner for Keyword Searches 

WordStream’s free keyword research tool is intended as a complementary tool to Google’s keyword planner. Both tools allow you to search for keywords to add directly to your account. One advantage WordStream’s keyword search tool has over Keyword Planner is the inclusion of concrete search volumes, rather than search volume ranges. Our hope is that this feature makes it easier for users to identify the exact keyword searches that matter to them. 

As a Google partner, our keyword finder benefits from a direct line to Google’s API, so you can ensure that the data you receive is verified and credible. At the same time, our keyword finder expands on Keyword Planner’s offering by bringing Bring data directly into the fold. So while you’re mining for Google keywords, don’t neglect the augmentative impact Microsoft keyword searches can have on overall performance. 

###  Your Multi-Purpose Keyword Analysis Tool 

Want to analyze keywords? WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool is an ideal choice. The Free Keyword Tool is a multi-purpose keyword analysis tool that allows you to analyze the keywords that matter most to you. 

Whether that means analyzing keywords with the highest intent to your products and services, analyzing keywords with tenable levels of competition so you can rank near the top of the page, or simply analyzing search volume: identify the keywords across Google and Bing that can really make a difference in your account. 

###  A Website Keyword Analysis Tool For Any Business 

One other great feature our tool is equipped with is the ability to analyze keywords from your website. A website keyword analysis is the quickest way to generate keyword ideas directly from your product pages and content. 

So if you don’t have a pre-filled list of keywords to pull from, simply enter your website or landing page and we’ll analyze the keywords therein for you. WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool is a robust, efficient website keyword analysis tool for any business. 

###  Using WordStream for SEO Keyword Research 

The Free Keyword Tool is primarily a tool used for finding and analyzing PPC keywords. That said, many of our customers and readers use the Free Keyword Tool for SEO keyword research as well. 

The search volumes you’ll find in the search volume column of our tool are accurate whether you’re bidding on a keyword, or writing organic content for it. Search volume is so pivotal to search marketing, as it gives you the ability to understand which keywords prospects are searching for the most in your industry. Find a good mix of search volume, competition level, and intent to your products and services, and you’ll be in a good spot. 

You can delineate SEO keywords by identifying keywords that are _informational_ in nature (as opposed to commercial). Long-tail keyword research, the art of finding keywords that are longer and more detailed, is a great way to surface keywords that would be better for blog posts than online ads. 

Want to use WordStream as a free keyword spy tool? Try typing your competitors’ homepage URLs into the URL bar. Doing so will allow you to identify the keywords that _they_ could realistically profit from bidding on or writing about. If _you_ then write about those keywords, or bid on them, you stand to gain some of your competitors’ traffic. 

###  Identifying Related Keywords and Popular Keywords 

We should discuss the art and importance of identifying both related keywords and popular keywords. If you don’t want to start with a URL, try starting with a keyword you think is related to your products and services. 

WordStream is a related keyword generator and keyword popularity tool in one: it will not only tell you the keywords that have the highest search volume, it will surface keywords related to your starting keyword that may be beneficial to your ad account or content strategy.
