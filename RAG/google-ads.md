##  What are Google Ads? 

Google Ads is the name of Google’s pay-per-click (PPC) platform, which allows businesses to gain visibility across Google’s properties. The most common type of Google Ads ad is the search ad, which appears on the [ search engine results page ](/serp "serp") (SERP) for searches relevant to the advertiser’s products and services—but businesses also [ use Google Ads ](https://www.wordstream.com/how-to-use-google-adwords) to run display ads, shopping ads, YouTube ads, and more. 

###  Google search ads 

Below is an example of a Google SERP containing ads. There are two sections of paid results: one above the nonpaid or [ organic results ](/organic-keyword) , and one below.

###  Google display ads 

As mentioned above, you can also run display campaigns which appear on the Google Display Network—an extensive collection of outside, third-party websites that have agreed to serve Google ads. [ Google Display ads ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads) can be in text, image, video, or rich media format, and can be targeted differently—such as through audiences and [ remarketing ](/google-remarketing)

###  Google shopping ads 

Google shopping ads appear on both the regular SERP and in the shopping tab. These ads operate differently from regular [ search ads ](https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/) since you can’t target keywords. Instead, you maintain a detailed catalog of your products and Google will match them to searches. You can, however, tell Google which keywords you don’t want your ads to appear for.

###  YouTube ads 

Since Google owns it, [ YouTube advertising ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube) is done through Google Ads. You can create video, text, or display ads that appear during and before videos and elsewhere on the platform. YouTube ad targeting operates similarly to display targeting.

##  Why Google Ads appear on the SERP 

Google Ads is focused around [ keywords, ](/keyword) the words that people are most likely to use when searching for their product. When advertisers create a Google Ads search campaign, they create ad with a specific offer and choose a list of [ keywords ](/keyword) to target that are relevant to the offer. When someone searches on Google (also known as a query), Google will check to see if any advertisers are bidding on keywords relevant to that search. If there are, ads will appear on that SERP. 

How does Google decide which ads to show? Enter: the Google Ads auction.

[ _View the full auction infographic here._ ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work)

We explain, in full, [ how the Google Ads auction works here ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work) , but we’ll pare it down for a quick version. If, when someone searches on Google, advertisers are bidding on keywords relevant to the query, Google will enter all keywords into the auction that it deems relevant—one per account. 

It will first give each keyword a Quality Score from 1-10, based on its relevance to the query and other factors. Then, it will give each keyword an Ad Rank score by multiplying its Quality Score by the corresponding advertiser’s maximum bid. The ads with the highest Ad Rank scores are the ones that show.

To “win” the Google Ads auctions and see your Google advertisement appear for relevant keywords, you’ll need to optimize your **Quality Score and bid amount** . The higher your [ Quality Score ](/quality-score "quality score") , in conjunction with your bid amount, the better your [ ad positioning ](/ad-position " ad marketing") . The following factors (among others) affect your Quality Score: 

  * The **relevance** of your Google ad to the search query 
  * The **relevance** of the Google keyword to your [ ad group ](/ad-groups " ad group")
  * The **relevance** of your ad to its landing page 
  * The historical **click-through rate** ( [ CTR ](/click-through-rate " a good click through rate") ) of the ad and its ad group 
  * Overall **historical account performance**



There are also overall benefits to having a high quality score: 

  * **Lower costs** – Google rewards advertisers with high Quality Scores by lowering their cost per click (CPC), helping improve ROI. 
  * **Higher exposure** – When you have high Quality Scores, your ads will display more often, in better positions on the SERP—the top vs. the bottom of the page. This enables you to get more clicks and conversions _without_ having to raise your bids.
