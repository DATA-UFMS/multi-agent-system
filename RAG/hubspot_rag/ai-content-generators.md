#  AI Content Generators: I Tested 6 of the Best; Here's What I Found

Updated:  06/04/24 

I‘m going to be fully transparent here. As I write this blog post, I’m on a train to the other side of my state. If you're a busy marketer or content creator like I am, chances are you’re always on the go for your next project (figuratively or literally). 

You could probably use some tools to streamline or automate aspects of content marketing, saving you time and allowing you to move on to the next big thing on your to-do list. 

[ 67% of marketers ](/marketing/benefits-of-ai) say the biggest benefit of AI is its ability to create content faster. If this sounds enticing to you, then you've come to the right blog post. 

I tested and reviewed six AI content generators to see how they work and whether they can benefit marketers and creators. Keep reading to learn about my experience and see if any of these generators could be an excellent assistant to your workflow.

##  How I Tested the Best AI Content Generators 

To test the best AI content generators I could find, I signed up for a free trial and played around with the available features. I then documented my experience and noted features I enjoyed and ones that could be improved. 

Remember, I'm only sharing my personal experience using the tools, so I suggest trying them out for yourself to see if they can be a great assistant to your workflow. 

To get the most out of the generators I review, it‘s always best to already have an excellent idea you want to bring to life. 

If you’re having writer's block or trouble coming up with an idea, consider using the [ HubSpot Blog Ideas Generator ](https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator?hubs_post-cta=EN-blog-pm) to generate content ideas. 

Then, bring those ideas to the generators below. 

##  The Best AI Content Generators 

###  1\. [ Craiyon ](https://www.craiyon.com/)

Craiyon is an easy and free AI image generator. Below, I tested it by asking it to create an AI image of a happy cat eating food. As you can see, it provides different options for the image's style. 

I can choose to have it look like art, a photograph, or a drawing. 

Scroll the carousel below to see how each style came out. 

**1** Craiyon's landing page 

**2** Photo generated using the "Art" option 

**3** Images generated using the "Draw" option 

**4** Image generated using the "Photo" feature 

Craiyon also allows users to tweak the generated images by removing the background, changing its color, or upscaling the quality of the image. 

**Pros:** The platform is very straightforward and simple to use. 

**Cons:** While the platform is free, users utilizing the free tier will have to watch 60 seconds of ads between each use. So, if you're pressed for time or, like me, lack patience, this could be frustrating. 

**Best for:** Quickly generating images to complement a marketing campaign. 

Price:  [ Paid tiers ](https://www.craiyon.com/pricing) start at $5 per month billed annually. 

###  2\. [ Rytr ](https://rytr.me/)

Rytr is an AI writing generator unlike any I've tested before. The platform has a free tier, is straightforward, and is user-friendly. I especially like that as 40 different use cases, users can choose from to get the content they need. 

When I started my free Ryter account, I had to answer a few prompts about what kind of content I wanted to generate and what I hoped to get from the platform. Once I answered those questions, I was taken to a dashboard resembling ChatGPT. 

The left side of the dashboard contains tools, settings, and options for use cases, tone, and language. 

I asked Rytr to generate a blog idea and outline about marketing to Gen Z. Here's what it generated: 

![Rytr3](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Rytr3.png?width=614&height=273&name=Rytr3.png)

Rytr also allowed me to download the outline via a Google Doc file or other file—super convenient! 

**Pro:** Versatile use cases and intuitive, user-friendly design. 

**Cons:** The free tier has very limited credits that can be used monthly. 

**Best for:** Generating written marketing materials such as emails, blog posts, outlines, headlines, or messages. 

Price: [ Paid tiers ](https://rytr.me/pricing/) start at $7.50 per month. 

###  3\. [ Simplified ](https://app.simplified.com/)

I am blown away by Simplified's number of AI tools and generators. The platform includes: 

  * An AI Designer to create Ads, thumbnails, and presentations 
  * AI Video generator to create videos and clips 
  * AI Writer to create branded written content 
  * Social Media AI to manage digital platforms 
  * AI Chatbot to create an AI assistant 



I decided to try out its AI Thumbnail Maker because it seemed simple enough. All I needed to do was clarify what the video was about and select the thumbnail size. 

From there, I can select a template or skip it to generate it immediately. Curious about the templates, I selected one before proceeding. 

And then, I was told I needed to sign up for a plan to proceed, which was a little disappointing. I ran into a similar issue when I tried other AI tools on the platform. Only getting far enough to see how easy they are to use but not enough to see the results. 

However, I was able to look at features that were free to me, and I can confirm Simplified's AI Designer has plenty of templates and tools that make image generation a breeze. 

**1** Screenshot of Simplified's AI Video Generator 

**2** Templates from Simplified AI 

**Pros:** Versatile AI tools that can be used to generate video, copy, thumbnails, and more 

**Cons:** Many require a paid plan to use to their full potential 

**Best For:** Streamlining content creation workflows such as copywriting and image generation 

Price:  [ Paid tiers ](https://app.simplified.com/pricing?) start at $10 per month. 

###  4\. ChatGPT 

Of course, I can‘t write about AI content generators without mentioning ChatGPT, right? If you don’t know what ChatGPT is, it's an AI chatbot that uses natural language processing to generate content and [ answer queries ](https://blaze.today/blog/best-free-ai-answer-generators/) . 

I've tested ChatGPT several times for script writing, blog writing, headlines, and generating social media copy. To use it, you just need to sign up for a free account. 

Let's say I want to generate some headline ideas for a blog post about how to market to Gen Z. 

I would simply type into ChatGPT, “Generate 5 headlines for a blog post about "How to Market to Gen Z." 

From there, the chatbot will generate five possible headlines for me to use. 

![chatgpt how to market to Gen Z](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/chatgpt%20how%20to%20market%20to%20Gen%20Z.png?width=3756&height=1722&name=chatgpt%20how%20to%20market%20to%20Gen%20Z.png)

Simple and straight to the point. 

**Pros:** Easy to use, free, and widely available 

**Cons:** Information generated by ChatGPT may not always be up to date. Plus, you will likely have to spend extra time tweaking the content to your liking. 

**Best for:** Generating social media copy, blog outlines, metadata, and headlines. 

###  5\. [ Narrato ](https://narrato.io/user-info)

Narrato is an AI-powered content creation workspace that allows creators and marketers to to manage their entire content creation process on just one platform. 

Narrato offers a few content creation tools, but the one that sticks out the most is its AI Content Genie. 

The AI Content Genie automatically generates social or blog content based on the theme of your website. To use the tool, type in the URL of your website and enter keywords pertaining to your theme. 

I have a website where I discuss anime, manga, and comics, so I entered the URL and keywords relevant to my topic. 

![Screenshot of my website URL going into Narrato](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Narrato.png?width=630&height=281&name=Narrato.png)

I'm not exaggerating when I say I’ve never seen an AI content-generating tool like this. Less than a minute after entering the URL of my website, Narrato was able to scan its content and create relevant social media and blog posts within my niche. 

In the screenshots below, the platform shows the draft of a post that mentions specific content on my site, such as a recent blog post I uploaded and my podcast, Nerds at Work. 

**1** Social media post for my blog, TsundEri. 

**2** Narrato-generated social media post for my blog TsundEri 

I don't know if I should be impressed or a little weirded out. Either way, I can definitely see busy content creators and marketers automating their social media marketing with this platform. 

Of course, Narrato also allows users to edit, schedule, and publish the content if it's up to par. The AI Content Genie and generate and schedule on your behalf on a weekly basis if you desire. 

**Pros:** Narrato's AI Content Genie is quick, intuitive, and impressively thorough. It can also generate and schedule content weeks in advance. 

**Cons:** There is no free tier. 

**Best for:** Automating your social media content posts. 

###  6\. [ Plus AI ](https://www.plusdocs.com/)

Plus AI is an AI content generator that creates AI PowerPoint and Google Slides presentations for you. There are a lot of AI apps for writing and images, but they don’t really work for making slide decks. 

As a marketer, one of the most time-consuming things for me is creating presentations for meetings - client presentations, internal strategy docs, reports. That’s why I’m glad there are AI tools to take care of this for me! 

After figuring out how to install the add-in, using Plus AI was easy - you just upload a doc or write a prompt. Then it will create a slide deck for you. Here I asked it to create an SEO strategy for a B2B software blog. 

1\. Preview of Plus AI PowerPoint presentation ![Plus AI 1](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Plus%20AI%201.webp?width=804&height=452&name=Plus%20AI%201.webp)

3\. Plus AI presentation ![Plus AI 3](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Plus%20AI%203.webp?width=804&height=452&name=Plus%20AI%203.webp)

The best part is you can share the presentation like a normal PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation when you’re done. So no one needs to know it was created with AI! 

**Pros:** Native integration with PowerPoint. 

**Cons:** There is no free tier but does have a free trial. 

**Best for:** Marketers and professionals who use a lot of slide decks. 

Price: Paid tiers start at $10 per month. 

AI content generators are here, and they aren‘t going anywhere, but you don’t need to use AI if you feel it isn't relevant to your business. That said, the AI tools I listed above are worth checking out if you want to save time and boost efficiency 

Okay, my train is about to pull in. Talk to you later!
