##  What is AI in content marketing? 

While there’s no standard definition of “AI in content marketing,” I will attempt to build one based on the understanding of the two concepts. 

Corey Wainwright [ describes content marketing ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy-guide) as a “marketing program that centers on creating, publishing, and distributing content for your target audience — usually online — the goal of which is to attract new customers.” 

Google [ defines ](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence?__hstc%3D20629287.6ad6fdfc00370278f238d4ec7d08f967.1741015766962.1741015766962.1741018373444.2%26__hssc%3D20629287.7.1741018373444%26__hsfp%3D867848667) AI as “a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more.” 

Combining these two concepts into one definition for AI in content marketing would look like this: 

AI in content marketing involves using technologies that analyze data, understand language, and make recommendations to create, publish, and distribute content designed to engage an online audience.

##  Benefits & Most Popular Ways to Use AI in Content Marketing 

![graph showing the tasks marketers typically use ai in content marketing for](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-1-20250328-6773600.webp)

I’ve gathered some of the most popular applications of AI in content marketing, and their benefits are below. 

###  1\. Text-based Content Creation 

In our 2025 State of AI report, 55% of marketers placed content creation as the most popular use case of AI in content marketing. This echoes what we found last year but with an impressive uptick of 12%.To note that, the growing reliance on an [ AI reporting tool ](https://dashthis.com/ai-reporting-tool/) also indicates a shift toward data-backed content strategies that help marketers measure what’s working in real time. 

Content can take many forms — written, visual, video, and audio, but let’s face it: writing isn’t everyone’s favorite task or most natural skill, so it’s no surprise to see the prominence of text-based pieces. [ Generative AI ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-generative-ai) can bring this to life at scale. 

“As a PR professional working with high-growth SaaS startups and VC firms, AI enables us to craft more personalized stories that resonate deeply with their audiences, drive engagement, and ultimately, build stronger, more credible brands,” [ Sim Aulakh ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simaulakh/) , founder of PR firm [ EstablishCred ](https://establishcred.com/) , says. 

But remember, don’t make the mistake of using AI-generated text without making it your own. HubSpot Principal Marketing Manager and blogger [ Ramona Sukhraj explains why ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-content-humanization?) . 

“Despite the operational positives, AI is plagued by concerns about [ plagiarism ](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/copyleaks-openai-chatgpt-plagiarism?hubs_content%253Dblog.hubspot.com%252525252Fmarketing%252525252Fauthor%252525252Framona-sukhraj%2526hubs_content-cta%253DAI%252525252520Media%252525252520Planning%25252525253A%2525252525206%252525252520Expert%252525252520Tactics%252525252520You%252525252520Can%252525252527t%252525252520Ignore%3D%26hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing%252Fauthor%252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3DHow%252520to%252520Humanize%252520AI%252520Content%252520So%252520It%252520Will%252520Rank%25252C%252520Engage%25252C%252520and%252520Get%252520Shared%252520in%2525202025) , [ bias ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-bias) , data security, and the potential for [ government regulation ](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/why-ai-still-needs-regulation-despite-impact/?hubs_content%253Dblog.hubspot.com%252525252Fmarketing%252525252Fauthor%252525252Framona-sukhraj%2526hubs_content-cta%253DAI%252525252520Media%252525252520Planning%25252525253A%2525252525206%252525252520Expert%252525252520Tactics%252525252520You%252525252520Can%252525252527t%252525252520Ignore%3D%26hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing%252Fauthor%252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3DHow%252520to%252520Humanize%252520AI%252520Content%252520So%252520It%252520Will%252520Rank%25252C%252520Engage%25252C%252520and%252520Get%252520Shared%252520in%2525202025) . In other words, raw AI content can be very problematic as it is derivative by nature. 

You see, [ AI content generators ](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/ai-writing-generator) are built on existing content commonly gathered from the Internet. This is how they “learn.” Every time you enter a prompt or query into a tool, AI simply reaches into this knowledge bank and picks out what it thinks is most relevant to what you want. 

That means it just compiles things already out there. There’s no guarantee that your results will be different from what the tool produces for another user or even from what’s already published online. 

It also certainly won’t be written with [ your brand’s voice or differentiators in mind ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand) , or offer the expertise, experience, authoritativeness, or trustworthiness (EEAT) [ Google SERP demands ](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing%252Fauthor%252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3DHow%252520to%252520Humanize%252520AI%252520Content%252520So%252520It%252520Will%252520Rank%25252C%252520Engage%25252C%252520and%252520Get%252520Shared%252520in%2525202025%26__hstc%3D20629287.6ad6fdfc00370278f238d4ec7d08f967.1743006985574.1743006985574.1743006985574.1%26__hssc%3D20629287.2.1743006985574%26__hsfp%3D2857618120) of the pages it ranks.” 

Our survey supported this idea, finding that only 7% of marketers use AI to create entire pieces without editing. 56% of marketers significantly revise AI-generated text or change it completely, while 38% make minor tweaks before publishing. 

**Benefits:** In using [ generative AI ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/generative-ai) to do anything from writing marketing copy to turning text into video, marketers can save time and increase productivity in the content creation process. 

###  2\. Research 

Great marketers are also [ great researchers ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-research-methods) . 

Content marketers, in particular, need to know enough about customers, competitors, and their industry to make confident decisions about the entire content production pipeline. That’s likely why research came in as our second most popular use case for AI in content marketing, with just over 47%. 

AI tools can be quite useful in finding information and analyzing volumes of data to identify trends, keywords, and relevant information, all in record time. 

For example, HubSpot’s new [ AI Search Grader ](https://www.hubspot.com/ai-search-grader?hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-in-content-marketing%26hubs_post-cta%3DAI%2520Search%2520Grader) — a first-of-its-kind, free app that quickly analyzes your brand based on what your prospects and customers are seeing across AI search engines — gives you actionable recommendations on how to improve. Imagine the wonders this would do for any marketing team. 

**Benefits:** Besides saving time and effort, using AI for content marketing research guarantees that decisions are made more quickly and confidently than manual research. Advanced AI models can even extract up-to-date information for more accurate content planning.

Believe it or not, [ 74% of consumers ](https://www.psfk.com/trend/shopper-education-assistance-trend-ai-powered-customer-service-chatbots/r/recC7SS3Whf2V7dJS?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) prefer to talk to a chatbot when looking for quick answers. But why exactly? 

“Consumers expect instant access, real conversations, and brands that respond like real people, not corporate robots,” explains Rachel R. Pitchford, Owner & Principal Consultant at Life Advisors. “It’s not just about solving problems; it’s about showing up where people already are and proving that your brand listens, cares, and acts.” 

Unfortunately, fielding questions and conversing in real-time isn’t always possible, especially for small businesses. 41% of brands are using AI to help, whether it be on their website or social media. 

[ 50% of marketers ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-trends-report) already use an automated response tool to field customer service requests on social media, while others have website chatbots that start a conversation with users when they visit specific pages (e.g., [ pricing ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pricing-page-examples) or demo page). 

HubSpot even uses this strategy on its website: 

![screenshot showing the ai chatbot used on hubspot’s pricing page](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-2-20250328-6399250.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.onepeloton.com/?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label)

A chatbot like this can deliver relevant content, offers, or even just ask if the user has questions. 

**Pro tip:** [ Drift ](https://www.drift.com/?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) , [ Facebook Messenger ](https://messenger.com/?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) , [ Slack ](https://slack.com/?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) , and ManyChat are great options to set up chatbots or automated conversations for your business, but if your website is hosted on HubSpot, you can also use [ HubSpot Conversations ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/conversations?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-b2b-marketing%26hubs_post-cta%3DHubSpot%2520Conversations) .

###  4\. Media Content Creation 

[ According to our findings ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-trends-report?hubs_signup-url%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-social-media-marketing-report%26hubs_signup-cta%3DAccording%2520to%2520our%2520findings%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-social-media-marketing-report%26hubs_post-cta%3DAccording%2520to%2520our%2520findings) , generating media content is also a popular use case for AI. (I’m honestly surprised it wasn’t #1.) 

56% of marketers reported using AI to create short-form videos, while 53% are using it to generate images, and 42% are creating long-form videos. 

![graph showing the tasks marketers typically use ai to create for social media marketing](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-4-20250328-4152556.webp)

**Benefits:** Many small businesses and entrepreneurs lack the design and visual arts skills needed to produce visual content, the time to develop them, or the budget to hire them. 

Artificial intelligence helps overcome these challenges to create beautiful results and keep them competitive. 

###  5\. Data Analysis and Reporting 

To learn how content is faring in the market and impacting the business, marketers need data analytics. AI-powered analytics tools can evaluate content performance and generate detailed reports on engagement metrics, ROI, and audience behavior. 

For instance, you can upload a spreadsheet of data into ChatGPT and ask it to summarize any prominent trends for you or ask for recommendations based on it. 

It can also analyze and interpret data faster than humanly possible to: 

  * Provide and explore insights 
  * Segment your customers 
  * Identify customer trends and preferences 
  * Create dashboards and reports (and even [ automatically email you the report ](https://youtu.be/fayBEXSKyoI?feature%253Dshared%3D%26hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) )

**Benefits:** Provides data-driven and actionable insights for optimizing content strategies and could also automate reporting. This improves the quality of decisions the marketer makes which, in turn, affects performance positively. 

##  Challenges of Using AI in Content Marketing 

As great as AI sounds for content marketing, it still has some challenges — especially when it comes to content generation. 

###  Data Quality 

Data quality is one of the most significant concerns when it comes to AI use of any kind. 

Artificial intelligence typically generates content based on information and data gathered from the internet or learned from other users, and unfortunately, not everything out there is based on facts. 

Our survey found that 43% of marketers struggle with AI generating inaccurate information. 

Knowing this, you can’t always know if the content you get from AI is sound or based on reliable sources. This can be dangerous when using AI to generate things like educational blog articles or doing research. 

###  Plagiarism 

The way AI “learns” also comes with [ the risk of plagiarism. ](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/copyleaks-openai-chatgpt-plagiarism?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label)

If you’re using AI to generate content, it will be inherently derivative — based on things that already exist. Because of this, there’s always the possibility that your results may be similar to something already ranking or even those delivered to another user. 

Imagine publishing a blog article with almost the same exact content as one of your competitors. Not only does this look back to your audience, but it also hurts you in search engine results. 

###  Bias 

Whether you’re generating content or doing research, it’s not uncommon to see bias when working with AI. 34% of our survey respondents agree, [ including HubSpotter Sukhraj ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-ai-image-generator) . 

![screenshot showing an account of ai bias discovered by ramona sukhraj](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-5-20250328-7854502.webp)

Flori Needle, senior marketing manager at HubSpot, reflects on why, saying, “AI is biased because society is biased.” 

“Since society is biased, much of the data AI is trained on contains society’s biases and prejudices…For example, an image generator asked to create an image of a CEO might produce images of white males because of the historical bias in employment in the data it learned from.” 

You may also see stereotypes or bias emerge in your strategic suggestions or research. So, be wary. 

###  Privacy 

While AI can genuinely help speed up your work, you often have to share detailed information to produce worthwhile results (i.e. maybe your buyer persona, brand guidelines). [ AI is currently unregulated ](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/why-ai-still-needs-regulation-despite-impact/?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) , so there is no guarantee your shared information won’t be stored or passed on to others. 

41% of marketers in our survey cited data privacy concerns as the primary barrier in their AI use. 75% prioritize this when evaluating new AI tools.

##  How I Use AI in Content Marketing 

To help illustrate how you can use AI in content marketing, let’s walk through a potential scenario from start to finish. 

Without a good idea, it’s impossible to get the content on the road to either attract or engage audiences. So, we’ll start with brainstorming. 

Assume I’m a content marketer at HubSpot who needs a cool video idea for distribution on our social media channels. 

I found a cool AI brainstorming platform called [ Ideamap AI ](https://ideamap.ai/) and asked it to brainstorm a video content idea for HubSpot, after providing context on what kind of brand HubSpot is. You’ll find that the map it produces is a bit much, considering that I already have trouble deciding what I want to do. 

I chose the first idea and used the expand with AI option to generate more ideas or inspiration for marketing content. 

![screenshot of ideamap ai](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-6-20250328-3831368.webp)

One way AI can be used for ideas or inspiration is by creating a mood board with tools like [ Kive.ai ](http://kive.ai/) . 

Given the sheer range of options for expansion and transformation available, it is nearly impossible not to find something you would be willing to work on. 

So, we are creating an animated explainer video showcasing how HubSpot connects marketing, sales, and customer service. 

To get accurate information needed for this video, I will need to extract it from the website. This time, I will employ the research abilities of ChatGPT Plus, which can pull real-time information from the internet. 

![screenshot of chatgpt plus](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-7-20250328-5811562.webp)

While it does a good job of extracting the information (from six sites), the output is not exactly video material. So, the next step would be to ask it to create the video script, which would kickstart the content creation process. 

I can also verify the claims ChatGPT made — or find more relevant information for my research — with [ HubSpot’s AI Search Grader ](https://www.hubspot.com/ai-search-grader?hubs_post-cta%3DEN-blog-pm%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-in-content-marketing) . In short, this tool gauges a brand’s visibility in AI search engines and reveals any extra details AI assistants display whenever users ask something related to the brand in question. 

![screenshot of chatgpt plus results](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-in-content-marketing-8-20250328-346466.webp)

For example, ChatGPT mostly covers HubSpot’s ease of use, expansive toolset, and great customer support. I could use these details in the intro of my video script. 

Speaking of which, the next step would be to go back to ChatGPT and ask it to create the video script, which would kickstart the content creation process. 

Since OpenAI’s Sora has still not been released to the public, I had to find available alternatives. It is worth mentioning here that 70% of the marketers we surveyed say they cannot wait to use the new tech. 

However, [ Elai ](https://elai.io/) , an intuitive AI video creator, came in handy. 

Creating the video with the script ChatGPT helped me create was indeed straightforward, although I must mention that there were not many video editing options to choose from. 

Using an avatar, an American voice sample and a blank background with HubSpot’s brand color were as far as I could go, especially as someone with limited video editing skills. 

While I think this attempt was far from flawless, it was a solid effort. With some additional time to refine the details, I believe it has the potential to be even better. 

##  AI in Content Marketing Examples 

###  1\. Generating Images: Nazrana 

Recently, OpenAI launched its most advanced [ AI image generator ](/marketing/best-ai-image-generator) to date, and it included a style mimicking the work of Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli. Social media has since exploded with images in the style. 

One brand that jumped on the trend was New Jersey-based South Asian fashion retailer Nazrana. The retailer, known for its South Asian version of "Say Yes to the Dress," used the tool to create and share images of some of the couples it has worked with over the years.

###  2\. Generating Ideas & Inspiration: Mateo Toro 

There’s an abundance of marketing professionals leveraging AI to boost their productivity and enhance their strategies. 

For example, filmmaker and photographer [ Mateo Toro ](https://www.mateotoro.com/about) recently started using Kive.ai to design mood boards to develop treatments for his film projects. 

A video treatment is a way to convey a project's concept or story. Many video treatments involve the use of images and visual media found online or in previous works. 

“Video treatments take time. You have to scrub through the video, take screenshots, and edit for the video treatment,“ Toro explained. ”[Kive.ai] just makes it so much easier for me to find the video that has a style or tone I'm looking to emulate.” 

With Kive.ai, creators can paste the link of a video into the system, and Kive.ai will extract frames from the video as screenshots to import into a board. Toro says the process can save him hours of time. 

“In a video treatment, I could be going through 10, 15, 20 videos to reference,“ he said. “You add that up, and it could easily be an hour of time just scrubbing through, screenshotting, and dragging content to a treatment.”

###  3\. Writing Copy: Bethany Anderson 

Then there’s [ Bethany Anderson ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethany-anderson-pr/) , a public information officer for Milton, Florida, who says ChatGPT streamlines the writing aspect of her job. 

“I love it because ChatGPT is a software that learns,” Anderson explains. 

She says ChatGPT can mimic her writing style, so she’ll sometimes use the tool to write press releases, social media posts, and SEO-friendly blog content. 

Anderson says the tool is handy because writing is a crucial part of her job, but it’s far from the only responsibility she has to tackle daily. 

“I am behind the scenes planning events and getting them out to the public,” she says. “So, ChatGPT allows me to get the writing done in a very easy, seamless way so that I can get to the bones of my job — which is outreach.” 

Anderson admits she was wary of ChatGPT at first but tested it out during a week that was jam-packed with deadlines. 

“There was this one week a couple of months ago when I had so many deadlines, so many social media calendars due, so many blogs due, and so many bios due — I was drowning,” she recalls. “So, I said, ‘I’m going to give it a try.’” 

Days’ worth of writing assignments could be completed in just a few hours thanks to the assistance of AI, according to Anderson. 

Her experience aligns with the findings of our survey — nearly 80% of marketers said generative AI has a positive ROI on their content writing tasks. 

“We’re talking about days of your life that you get back,” she said. “And, to me, time is valuable. It's more valuable than money.”

###  4\. Editing Drafts: Irina Nica 

On the other hand, [ Irina Nica ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irinanica/?originalSubdomain%253Die) , former HubSpot Senior Product Marketing Manager, used HubSpot’s [ AI Content Writer ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms/ai-content-writer?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-in-content-marketing%26hubs_content-cta%3DAI%2520Content%2520Writer%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-in-content-marketing%26hubs_post-cta%3DAI%2520Content%2520Writer) to edit her drafts. 

“It's like having a second pair of eyes that helps me go through my drafts, tidy them up, and get them out there faster. Don’t get me wrong … Writing is a huge part of my job and something that AI can’t take over, but it sure helps to speed up the nitty-gritty bits like editing.” 

She also used [ ChatSpot ](https://chatspot.ai/) , HubSpot’s AI chatbot solution designed to help businesses perform marketing and sales operations, to supercharge her research. 

“I like to use ChatSpot for getting quick recommendations for products, books, or any type of resource really. Say I‘m looking for the best product marketing book for SaaS companies; normally, I’d be knee-deep in Google searches, reading articles, and checking out recommendations on Goodreads,” Nica says. 

“But with the right prompt, ChatSpot can get me there 10X faster. I still give its final recommendation a quick Google check, but it's a super handy shortcut.” 

##  Future of AI for Content Marketing 

###  Will AI replace content creators? 

A common concern surrounding the use of AI is whether the technology will replace human marketers and creators. [ Nima Olumi ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nima-olumi-738a92ab/) of Lightyear Strategies says it’s unlikely. 

“We use AI to pull a lot of statistics, come up with interesting angles to pitch to companies, and work around certain angles that are marketing and media-friendly,” Olumi said. “I don‘t think it’s a complete replacement for writers or thinkers.” 

Writing and content creation are subjective fields, according to Olumi, and they still require people to do the necessary critical thinking to decide the kind of content that gets published. 

Ultimately, Olumi predicts a future where AI will assist marketers and creatives in improving their output and producing content in a shorter time. 

This makes sense, considering our survey found that 74% of marketers agree that AI tools can help them be more productive in their roles. 

Olumi encourages professionals to embrace AI and use it to their advantage rather than shy away. 

Specifically, he says creators should spend time learning and testing applications like Open.ai and ChatGPT to see their different capabilities. 

“Spend hours asking question after question to see how far you can push the limits of the application to serve your needs,” he said. “You have to feed it context.” 

##  Making the Most of AI 

As the presence of AI in marketing continues to grow significantly, I suggest you take the time to discover how it can best serve your own team's needs. 

Professionals and creatives like Olumi, Aulakh, Anderson, Nica, and Toro all found ways to use AI to help them improve the efficiency and quality of their content. 

Instead of worrying whether the robots will take over, I recommend finding ways to work alongside AI, so you and your company can remain competitive in the market and essential to your clients.
