Updated:  12/24/24 

AI is a hot topic for marketers — and for good reason. According to our [ State of AI ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-ai-report) report, 95% of respondents say that AI marketing tools help them spend less time on manual tasks and more time connecting with customers. 

** **

As a freelance writer and content creator, I’ve seen the benefits of AI first-hand. 

** [ ![Download Now: 100 ChatGPT Prompts for Marketers \[Free Guide\]](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c497a8fe-0f60-4244-9cb1-5bed4d1e5ab6.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/c497a8fe-0f60-4244-9cb1-5bed4d1e5ab6) **

From brainstorming ideas to offering grammar and style advice, intelligent tools have come a long way from answering simple yes/no questions — and still getting the answers wrong. 

With AI going mainstream, however, a host of companies are jumping on the bandwagon. The result? It’s hard to tell the difference between great apps, good apps, and “AI” apps that have no business using the acronym. 

Sure, you could scour the internet yourself for the best and brightest — or you could start with my curated list of the top 33 AI marketing tools.

##  **The Benefits of Using AI in Marketing**

OpenAI’s ChatGPT took the world by storm in November 2022. In December 2024, the site drew [ 1.6 billion visitors ](https://seo.ai/blog/how-many-users-does-chatgpt-have%23:~:text%3DHow%2520Many%2520Users%2520on%2520ChatGPT,users%2520on%2520a%2520weekly%2520basis.) , and 100 million users leverage ChatGPT every week. 

After the huge splash from the release of ChatGPT, there is little doubt that AI is impacting marketing jobs. Research from the [ University of Pennsylvania ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) estimates that “19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted." 

The key word in that statement, though, is _impacted_ . 

In my experience, this means that marketers who [ learn to leverage AI-powered tools ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/affordable-ai) will see better results from their campaigns and diversify their skills. 

I already use AI tools in my workflow. That doesn’t mean AI is writing my articles (this piece is 100% human!). 

However, drafting routine emails, improving the quality of images, turning long posts into social copy, and researching new topics often involve an AI assist. 

Beyond that, we’ve had teammates who use AI to help them leverage skillsets they don’t already have. I asked HubSpot’s Kaitlin Milliken for an example. 

“We had a huge project where we changed images on pages from .png to .webp files on thousands of web pages. I knew this would take forever to do manually, so I leveraged AI to help me create a Python script that could run the conversion,” says Milliken, who is a marketing manager at the company. 

“I don’t even know how to code in Python!” 

Today’s AI tools still have a huge growth potential. Still, those already available can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete tasks and reduce the lift for completing complex tasks, all while running 24/7 with no downtime. 

##  **What makes a great AI marketing tool?**

Every marketing campaign is unique. At their core, however, all campaigns have the same goal: connecting with potential customers. 

This lays the groundwork for finding a great AI tool: It needs to make the process of finding, engaging, and converting customers easier, faster, and more reliable. But what does this look like in the real world? 

Here are five things I look for in any AI marketing tool. 

![what makes a great ai marketing tool?](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-1-20241224-5044003.webp)

###  1\. Ease of Use 

If a marketing tool isn’t easy to use, no one will use it — especially not me. 

Even if a tool has great features and functions, marketing teams don’t have the time — or inclination — to watch hours of training videos or wade through complex instructions. 

I think the best AI marketing tools do most of the heavy lifting internally. Simple operations should be easy and accessible and scaffold users along the path to more multifaceted use cases. 

###  2\. In-Depth Reporting 

Marketing tools are only as good as the outcomes they deliver. For example, an AI marketing tool that drafts and sends promotional emails is worth the cost if emails are opened and links are clicked. 

Great tools include in-depth reporting that helps teams monitor and measure the performance of marketing campaigns over time. 

###  3\. Clear Data Use Policies 

AI depends on data. The more data provided, the better the outcomes. The challenge? Ensuring that data is collected and used ethically. 

For example, if companies use data that isn’t anonymized and without users’ permission, they can run into regulatory issues. 

Intelligent tools should include clear use policies that define how data is captured, where it’s coming from, and what steps are taken to protect user identities. 

###  4\. Great Support 

Despite best efforts, I don’t think any deployment can be perfect. And when problems happen, companies need the confidence that comes with reliable support. 

If I’m considering an AI marketing tool, I’m looking at what level of support is offered for the product or the “tier” of the product I purchase. 

If entry-level offerings come with minimal or no support, it’s worth carrying out a cost/benefit analysis. 

Does it make sense to deploy tools (even free tools) if your team can’t get support when something goes wrong?By the same token, does paying more for 24/7 support make sense if this helps meet marketing goals? 

###  5\. Straightforward Pricing 

Some tools offer free trials. Others require small or moderate monthly fees to provide access to all features, while still others may provide a set number of prompt requests or content pieces per month. 

Here, the model doesn’t matter as much as the money. Before signing on with any AI marketing provider, ask for a full breakdown of their fees. 

What does your monthly fee include? Are their limits? What happens if you go over those limits? Better to ask up-front and before the first bill arrives. 

##  **Benefits of AI Marketing Tools**

2024 was a breakout year for AI. Widespread adoption, however, comes with significant hype — meaning not all AI tools are created the same. 

In my experience using AI, I’ve seen both the good and the not-so-good. 

For example, while AI apps generally offer useful grammar and style suggestions, some of their recommendations make well-written paragraphs seem stilted or strange. 

AI for marketing offers the same potential — and the same pitfalls. The trick to getting the most from AI? Finding benefits backed by data. 

Here are five that can help maximize your marketing efforts.

###  **Saved Time**

According to HubSpot data, [ 86% of marketers ](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-marketing) say that using AI saves them one (or more) hours a day by streamlining creative tasks. 

By automating manual processes with AI, teams can focus on the human side of marketing — creating the engagement and forging the connections that keep customers coming back. 

###  **Improved Personalization**

As noted by the [ HubSpot 2024 State of Marketing Report ](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing) , 94% of marketers say that personalization boosts sales. 

AI helps enable personalization, with 77% of respondents reporting that generative AI helps them create more personalized content. 

It makes sense: When customers feel like people instead of simply profit sources, they’re more likely to buy once, and by again. Personalization, however, depends on in-depth customer understanding that evolves over time. 

AI tools help streamline this process. 

###  **Enhanced Productivity**

AI can also help improve productivity, with [ 45% of teams ](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing) reporting that AI tools make them more effective. 

As the number indicates, this is a work in progress. The primary challenges for marketers? Familiarity and comfort. 

Teams often have tools or processes they’ve used for years — even if AI significantly outperforms these solutions, staff often prefer familiar operations. 

Discomfort, meanwhile, often comes with the adoption of new technologies. In the case of AI, there’s a kind of “black box” effect since users aren’t entirely sure how AI works and how it reaches conclusions. 

If businesses give marketers time to explore and experiment with AI tools, however, there’s potential for enhanced productivity. 

###  **Streamlined Analytics**

AI tools excel at collecting and comparing data across multiple sources. This can lead to improved analysis of marketing data along with the identification of new or evolving consumer trends. 

Already, [ 44% of marketers ](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing) describe AI as “very effective” in performing data analytics. As tools continue to evolve, expect this number to increase. 

###  **Increased ROI**

The big one — ROI — takes our last spot. HubSpot research found that [ 68% of marketing leaders ](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-marketing) already report ROI on their AI investment. 

As tools become more widely adopted and users become more familiar with their operations, expect this number to rise.

**What I love:** With automated text analysis, marketing teams can also parse huge amounts of text and acquire valuable insights from customer feedback that people might miss.

###  **21.** **[ Brand24 ](https://brand24.com/) **

![brand24 ai marketing tool](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-17-20241224-592185.webp)

_[ Source ](https://brand24.com/) _

  * **Price:** Plans start at $69 per month. 
  * **Best for:** Social listening and sentiment analysis 
  * **What it does:** Sifts through massive amounts of information generated on public platforms, whether that’s social media or forums. Provides organizations with a dashboard that analyzes everything from mentions, the volume of discussion, and overall brand sentiment. 



Customers today expect brands to respond quickly on social media. 

The trouble is, if an organization is present across every major social media platform, there’s simply too much data to keep track of every comment, mention, and trending topic — and spot the signal through the noise. 

I think Brand24 is a great pick for businesses that need help identifying conversations that your community management, evangelists, or social media teams should be paying attention to. 

**What I love:** Brand24 insights can help you identify ways to improve your marketing campaign and even the product itself. 

###  **22.** **[ MarketMuse ](https://www.marketmuse.com/) **

![marketmuse ai tool optimization example](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-18-20241224-5749169.webp)

_[ Source ](https://crozdesk.com/software/marketmuse) _

  * **Price: Free.** Paid plans start at $149 per month. 
  * **Best for:** Content strategy and planning 
  * **What it does:** Analyzes your website and uncovers top opportunities in search, helping surface gaps in your content. 



Depending on how long your content engine has been running, the volume of content existing on your website could make auditing a time suck. MarketMuse can help you focus on what matters: creating better content your audience wants. 

I like to use MarketMuse for identifying blogs and content I have that fits keywords I need to target. This narrows down which blogs I should refresh and invest more time into. 

**What I love:** MarketMuse can help you find keywords that match your content. You’ll also see ways to optimize your content for search engine result pages. 

###  **23.** **[ Semrush ](https://www.semrush.com/swa/) **

![semrush seo](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-19-20241224-6420134.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.semrush.com/swa/) _

  * **Price:** Plans start at $119.95 per month. 
  * **Best for:** Search Engine Optimization 
  * **What it does:** Helps generate content and ensure your writing is optimized for SEO. 



Semrush has long been a top contender for managing keyword targeting for SEO and paid campaigns. Now, they’ve integrated AI in the form of The SEO Writing Assistant (SWA), making an already powerful platform even more robust. 

I personally use Semrush to build backlinks (a truly time-consuming marketing task) and for analyzing my competitor’s seo strategies. 

If you lack the budget for a product like BrightEdge, I think Semrush is a great substitute for those who need an AI SEO tool. 

**What I love:** SWA is exactly what it says on the tin. It’s like a personal writing assistant who can ensure your writing is targeted toward achieving the best results in search. 

###  **24.** **[ Crayon ](https://www.crayon.co/) **

![crayon competitive intelligence marketing tool](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-20-20241224-6707460.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.crayon.co/product/analyze) _

  * **Price:** Pricing is available upon request. 
  * **Best for:** Competitive intelligence 
  * **What it does:** Automatically gathers and organizes data from millions of sources to help you track industry trends. 



Similar to Semrush, Crayon has been a leader in their field for years. They’ve recently integrated AI to help sort through millions of data points from sources across the web to help you gain a better competitive advantage. 

Crayon’s AI and machine learning integrations help make sense of what information is important about your competitors and what’s just noise. 

I like that Crayon keeps track of SEC filings, pricing updates, and messaging pivots while summarizing the important information in an easy-to-share format. 

**What I love:** You can take a deep dive into competitors. Crayon assesses your competitors’ digital footprints to provide a view of the competitive landscape. 

###  **25.** **[ StoryLab.ai’s Video SEO Generator ](https://storylab.ai/ai-youtube-video-seo-generator) **

![example of ai powered seo generator from storylab](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-21-20241224-9566801.webp)

  * **Price:** Free, Pro, and Unlimited 
  * **Best for:** Optimizing YouTube Videos for SEO 
  * **What it does:** Creates catchy YouTube titles, descriptions, and tags 



StoryLab.ai’s YouTube Video SEO Generator helps you optimize your YouTube videos in seconds. 

As a video marketer, you want to create awesome content and engage with your audience, not worry about optimizing each video for SEO. 

Thanks to AI, you can simply describe what your video is about and AI will help you come up with catchy titles, descriptions, and tags. You can run the AI tool as often as you like and ensure you’re using all the right marketing copy to help your videos succeed. 

**What I love:** Next to the Video SEO Generator, StoryLab.ai also helps video marketers come up with engaging video ideas, scripts, hooks, and more! 

###  **26.** **[ Fotor ](https://www.fotor.com/) **

![ai marketing tool, fotor](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-22-20241224-2703206.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.fotor.com/) _

  * **Price:** Pricing starts at $39 per month. 
  * **Best for:** Multifunctional photo editing and generation 
  * **What it does:** As a multifunctional photo editing platform, you can easily finish your photo editing from uploading, and editing to exporting high-quality photos. 



Based on its powerful AI technology, Fotor offers users intelligent photo editing functions such as AI image generation and editing, turning text into image, one-click enhancement and perfection, and background removal. It features a comprehensive materials library of professional-grade templates for posters, cards, logos, and resumes. And social media content like YouTube covers, Instagram stories, and more. 

Fotor is a powerful AI-driven, feature-rich, and user-friendly platform for photo editing and graphic design. Whether a professional or beginner, it’s easy to find the tools and features tailored to suit your needs. 

**What I love:** Its AI technology makes photo editing more effortless and efficient. And it brings ultimate visual effects to your images. 

###  **27.[ Botpress ](https://botpress.com/?utm_source=hubspot&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hubspot-content-partnership&utm_content=marketing-ai-marketing-tools) **

_![Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 1.11.22 PM](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Screenshot%202025-09-02%20at%201.11.22%20PM.png?width=1690&height=867&name=Screenshot%202025-09-02%20at%201.11.22%20PM.png) [ Source ](https://botpress.com/?utm_source=hubspot&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hubspot-content-partnership&utm_content=marketing-ai-marketing-tools) _ [ ](https://botpress.com/?utm_source=hubspot&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hubspot-content-partnership&utm_content=marketing-ai-marketing-tools)

  * **Price:** Free. 
  * **Best for:** Automating sales, marketing, and support functions 
  * **What it does:** Powers custom AI workflows with the latest LLMs, connecting to company documents, knowledge bases, websites, or channels 



Botpress is an AI agent platform designed to simplify building custom AI agents. It’s like customizing your own ChatGPT — that can connect to your existing platforms and tools — without needing extensive coding skills. T he platform offers a user-friendly interface to build any kind of customized bot. 

These bots are powered by LLMs, but you can design them to follow your own bespoke business logic and train them on your own business data (think PDFs, docs, websites, etc). 

Plus, a bonus for less technical people: the Autonomous Node feature allows users to write instructions in plain text, and then it transforms them into an AI agent. 

**What I love:** Botpress can fully automate processes like customer support and AI lead generation. 

###  **28.** **[ Lavender ](https://www.lavender.ai/) **

![lavender email ai assistant](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-23-20241224-2913905.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.lavender.ai/) _

  * **Price:** Pricing starts at $29 per month. 
  * **Best for:** Email training 
  * **What it does:** Plugs directly into your email platform of choice and suggests how to improve email content to drive more replies. 



If you’re looking to optimize your emails, Lavender can help. Whether you’re writing an internal memo or a pitch for journalists, Lavender can compose the text for you — or just help you optimize your message. 

Lavender can also help your sales teams. Account executives and sales development representatives can craft personalized emails to hook prospects. 

I love the email feature because writing sales collateral is a time consuming part of my job and Lavender can reduce the time I spend. 

**What I love:** Lavender gathers prospect news, data, and insights so you can craft a personalized, timely message to close deals. 

###  **29.** **[ Braze ](https://www.braze.com/) **

![braze ai tool](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-24-20241224-5581453.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.braze.com/) _

  * **Price:** Pricing is available upon request. 
  * **Best for:** Customer intelligence 
  * **What it does:** Integrates with all your data sources (CRM, MAP, etc.) and looks for signals that a customer might be at risk for churn or shows interest in potential upsell opportunities. Suggests potential messaging strategies to use based on that same data. 



Many organizations have been laser-focused on customer retention. 

Braze helps even the smallest teams save thousands of hours sifting through data to understand what their customers need, whether that’s an additional feature or more engagement from their account managers. 

Sometimes, the signals related to churn are difficult to see. I love that Braze can help your sales team re-engage prospects with marketing content, customer support, and more. 

**What I love:** Braze can also help marketing create personalized offers using data. You can also A/B test your campaigns to see how they impact sales. 

###  **30.** **[ Axiom.ai ](https://axiom.ai/) **

![axiom ai automation tool](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-25-20241224-7045766.webp)

_[ Source ](https://axiom.ai/) _

  * **Pricing:** Plans start at $15 a month. 
  * **Best for:** Automation of repetitive tasks 
  * **What it does:** Automates scraping and interacts with websites in simple ways that previously required a person. 



Unlike the process flow automation offered by tools like Zapier, Axiom.ai falls into a category known as Robotic Process Automation. 

Axiom.ai can scrape data and automate simple tasks. Your team can gather data from Google Trends, automate website actions, and build bots. 

Axiom.ai can take on the brunt of mundane marketing tasks, and with its low price point it gets my vote as the top AI tool for automation. 

**What I love:** Axiom can scrape websites for data, extract information, or perform other simple user interface actions. 

###  **31.** **[ Hemingway ](https://hemingwayapp.com/) **

![hemingway ai content editing](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-26-20241224-8478715.webp)

_[ Source ](https://hemingwayapp.com/) _

  * **Pricing:** $19.99 
  * **Best for:** Content editing 
  * **What it does:** Analyze your content and suggest where you could make it clearer, more concise, or improve your diction. 



As Strunk and White suggest, you should omit needless words when writing. The only question that we sometimes have is, which ones? 

Hemingway uses AI and machine learning to identify opportunities at a sentence level that can make your writing that much stronger. 

**What I love:** Hemingway gives you a readability score so you can assess your overall performance. 

###  **32.** **[ Grammarly ](https://www.grammarly.com/plans) **

![grammarly ai assistant](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-27-20241224-7448891.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.grammarly.com/plans) _

  * **Pricing:** Free basic tool or $12 USD a month for Premium 
  * **Best for:** Content editing, grammar, and AI writing 
  * **What it does:** Spell-checks, grammar checks, offers different tones for writing, and more. 



Grammarly is like a more grown-up Hemingway, with more features and a convenient plug-in for different browser types. 

I have been a long-time user of Grammarly, and if there’s one AI tool you need on this list for content marketing, it’s this one. 

The reason I’ve stuck with Grammarly for so long is because their grammar and spell check really are the best in the industry. 

If you want to sound and look professional on your blog, your writing really should be as close to 100% error-free as possible. 

I originally started with the free Grammarly version which made a difference in my writing, but the upgrade to Premium has been worth it for me. 

That's because I can now get suggestions in Google Docs, as well as take advantage of the AI content creator tool. 

**What I love:** Grammarly gives you professional writing-level grammar, spelling, and tone suggestions. 

###  **33.** **[ CallRail’s Conversation Intelligence ](https://www.callrail.com/conversation-intelligence) **

![callrail ai conversation intelligence tool](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-marketing-tools-28-20241224-6361180.webp)

_[ Source ](https://www.callrail.com/conversation-intelligence) _

  * **Pricing:** $85/month 
  * **Best for:** Call recording, transcription, and summaries 
  * **What it does:** Analyze all your calls, all the time, turning your conversations into easy-to-act-on data. 



Leveraging a robust AI trained with more than 650,000 hours of vocal data, Conversation Intelligence effortlessly transcribes and examines all your incoming and outgoing phone conversations with precision. 

It almost matches human expertise. 

This results in enhanced keyword detection, more precise auto-tagging, improved lead categorization, and refined sentiment analysis, freeing your team from countless hours of manual tasks. 

**What I love:** CallRail's conversation intelligence creates action-based analytics to determine the best way to interact with your customers and leads. 

##  **My Top Marketing AI Tool Picks**

The Breeze Content Agent, specifically, uses AI to create engaging content powered by your CRM data. 
  4. **Press releases:** [ Howler.AI. ](http://howler.ai) This tool is pricey but could potentially replace a corporate communications position by automating press releases and follow up. 
  5. **Building forms:** [ Involve.me. ](http://involve.me) The tool creates forms that actually convert with ease. 
  6. **Social media:** [ Predis.ai ](http://predis.ai) You can customize social media templates and automate your tasks. 
  7. **Automation:** [ Axiom.ai. ](http://axiom.ai) It takes on the brunt of mundane marketing tasks with a low price point. 



##  **Going Beyond ChatGPT**

My personal opinion here — especially after playing with all these tools — is that if you use AI ethically and with the right guidelines in place, it’s no different than any other tool. 

Whatever your marketing needs, I can guarantee there’s an AI tool out there that exists to make your job easier. 

In the meantime, move past just using ChatGPT and try out other AI tools that help streamline and simplify necessary marketing tasks. This was, your team can get back to doing what they do best: connecting with customers.
