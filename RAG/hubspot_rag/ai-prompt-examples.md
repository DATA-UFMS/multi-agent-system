Updated:  07/15/25 

I know prompting can seem easy at first glance. Go to your favorite AI tool, type in what you want, and then watch AI generate a ton of options in seconds. 

But it’s hardly that straightforward. 

[ ![Download Now: 100 ChatGPT Prompts for Marketers \[Free Guide\]](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c497a8fe-0f60-4244-9cb1-5bed4d1e5ab6.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/c497a8fe-0f60-4244-9cb1-5bed4d1e5ab6)

If your prompts aren’t specific, AI generates results based on what _it thinks_ you want. It’s similar to hiring a new team member and expecting them to produce results without giving them any context about your goals, audience, or the stage of your business. Rushed instructions will produce generic, off-brand outputs. 

My best prompts give AI a starting point. That’s either tons of data or context, a detailed brief, or specific examples of what I want the output to look like. Then, I experiment and refine. 

In this article, I’ll share examples of AI prompts I’ve used (and seen work) across email, blog, lead gen, and social campaigns. You can leverage these prompts to save time on content creation, improve content quality, and, most importantly, free up time for strategic work.

##  How do AI prompts work? 

A great AI prompt is specific, straightforward, filled with relevant information, and uses complete sentences. If your AI prompts deviate from the above qualities, the chances of getting unusable responses increase. 

In other words, all [ AI tools ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/generative-ai) share a commonality: “great prompt = great output.” 

##  **AI Prompts in Marketing Today**

Our recent [ State of AI survey ](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-marketing) , which surveyed over 1500+ marketing professionals, shows that marketers today are integrating AI heavily into their workflows. The leading use case is content creation, primarily text-based (55%). 

![bar graph survey results from state of ai asking about the biggest challenges with using gen ai in marketing](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-1-20250714-89292.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-marketing)

However, as the image above suggests, 31% agree that AI outputs don’t always hit the mark. While it’s true that you can’t completely rely on AI, success largely depends on prompt quality. 

![bar graph results from state of ai asking about effective prompting strategies](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-2-20250714-3715450.webp)

When asked about their prompting strategies, marketers from the 2024 AI survey by HubSpot highlighted experimentation as a key (55%). It’s not about writing one perfect prompt, but guiding the tool towards the desired outcome. 

Context (53%) also complements the above strategy — the more data you provide AI, the faster it’ll learn. To learn more about how marketers are leveraging AI, download the [ State of AI report ](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-marketing) . 

The only point from the study with which I disagree is keeping prompts short. **In my experience, longer, detailed prompts with specific boundaries and constraints tend to perform better.** I keep a swipe file of my high-performing prompts organized by format and use case (many of which I’ll share below). 

##  **Marketing AI Prompt Examples**

These AI prompt examples cover a wide range of use cases from blog writing to social media, lead generation, and video scripts. 

###  **Examples of AI Prompts for Marketers**

####  **Educational Prompts**

You can use these prompts to write top-of-the-funnel content on popular topics. I usually treat outputs from educational prompts as rough first drafts or research. Here are some examples: 

**1.** Write a beginner-friendly [word] blog on how [product] is being used in [industry]. Use real-world examples, define key concepts, and include a short FAQ at the end. 

**2.** Explore what overwhelms new users in [niche] when they try to solve [specific problem]. Suggest an educational content series for each pain point. 

**3.** List and explain the most critical elements of an effective [strategy type]. Include actionable takeaways readers can immediately apply. 

**4.** Compare and contrast [topic 1] and [topic 2] based on [criteria 1], [criteria 2], and [criteria 3]. 

**5.** Explain how [year] trends in [topic] are changing the landscape of [industry]. Use real examples, stats, and quotes from industry experts. Include the source for each stat and example. 

####  **Informative Prompts**

These prompts focus on creating content that builds authority and delivers valuable insights to readers. 

**6.** Write a newsletter debunking 3-5 common myths about [topic], backed by recent data or real case studies. Follow best practices of newsletter writing and end with a personal takeaway or CTA. 

**7.** Create an FAQ page for [product] that addresses the most frequently asked support questions. Use the attached [support ticket summaries] and format the output with clear/concise answers. 

**8.** Write help center content that explains how [popular software feature] works. Include step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips for common errors. 

####  **Listicle Prompts**

Listicles are my favorite thing to write — until I'm stuck on item 9 in a list of 10, or can’t find the right statistic to support my arguments. Listicle prompts help me brainstorm fresh ideas and simplify the research process. 

See some examples below. 

**9.** Write a listicle LinkedIn post: [number] Lessons I Learned from [milestone or failure]. Make it relatable with storytelling and add a final takeaway. 

**10.** List [number] statistics I can use in my article titled [topic] from this industry report: [report]. Here is the article outline: [structure]. 

**11.** List [number] frequently asked customer questions about [topic] in the intermediate stage, followed by suggested answers (under 50 words each). 

**12.** Create a list of [number] must-have tools for beginner [topic], each with a short use case. 

**13.** List [number] viral hook templates for [platform] posts in [niche], and explain why each one worked. 

####  **Technical Prompts**

These prompts help you generate step-by-step guides, case studies, product walkthroughs, and more. But, as the famous ChatGPT disclaimer states, _AI can get things wrong_ . So, I always verify technical details and test any instructions or code to ensure they actually work. That being said, let’s look at some technical AI prompts. 

**14.** Write a user-facing help center document for [product feature] based on [technical reference]. Copy should include steps to set up and use the product. Use visuals if needed. 

**15.** Write a technical case study showing how [client] used [product] to achieve [result]. Include: problem, outcome of that problem, proposed solution, steps taken to achieve the solution, and the final result. 

**16.** Create a strategy proposal for [client] struggling with [pain point] in the [industry]. Add costs, timelines, and results. 

###  Examples of AI Art Prompts 

AI art is good. Sometimes, shockingly good if you give it the right reference. I find it super useful for mascot concepts, product mockups, and capturing early design trends. I’ve even created presentations with viral trends like AI-generated Ghibli art. 

![](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-3-20250714-9119260.webp)

**17.** An image of a woman doing yoga in a gym setting. She should have her hair in a ponytail, wearing comfortable athletic wear. 

![ai prompt example for ai art creation](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-4-20250714-2232280.webp)

**18.** An image of a professional business meeting in a co-working space. Image should have five professionals talking to each other, while the lead is setting up the presentation and Zoom meeting. 

![ai prompt example for ai art creation](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-5-20250714-3171416.webp)

**19.** Over-the-shoulder shot of a laptop opening an AI SaaS product with a person in a casual shirt. The setting should be a cafe. 

**20.** Image of a person scrolling on their phone while sitting in a chair. Comfortable posture in natural lighting, facing a window that overlooks the mountain and nature. 

![ai prompt example for ai art creation, here is the image that was created from my prompt](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-6-20250714-5647302.webp)

**Here’s how you can access AI art:**

###  **Examples of AI Prompts for Lead Generation**

As a full-stack marketer, I do a lot of [ lead generation ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht) for myself (and my clients!). Over the years, I’ve sent out thousands of cold messages, testing different offers across multiple [ buyer personas ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research) . Email, Cold LinkedIn DMs, Facebook group posting, organic content — you name it, I’ve tried it. 

However, lead generation at scale can get quite repetitive. So, I turned to AI to help me automate bottlenecks like personalization and pull insights on my lead data. Here are some of my favorite prompts. 

**21.** Suggest [number] discovery questions to ask a social media client [client] who has these pain points: [pain points]. 

**22.** Compile our five common sales calls objections: [Call scripts]. For each, provide a concise answer showing ROI or cost-benefit justification. Also include potential follow-ups if the lead ghosts us. 

**23.** Write a cold DM outreach message for [product] with a personalized first line and frame the CTA around this challenge: [specific challenge]. Your copy should build trust. 

**24.** Analyze the UX of this competitor landing page [link] from the lens of a [B2B SaaS buyer] and extract five tactics they use to convert cold traffic into leads. Explain how I can improve [page] for the same audience. 

**25.** List 10 bonus resources I can offer inside a blog post on [topic] to drive email signups from [target audience]. 

**26.** Suggest positioning strategies for [product/service] as the no-brainer solution for [ICP] struggling with [pain point]. 

**27.** Identify target audience segments in [location] who are likely to buy [product] to solve [pain point]. Create audience profiles, messaging themes, and marketing channels. 

**28.** Analyze our CRM's last 50 closed-won deals: [upload sheet]. What common demographic and behavioral attributes did these customers share? Use that profile to suggest three ICP segments we should target next. 

**29.** Create a questionnaire for an onboarding call with a potential client in the [industry]. Include questions I’d need to ask to perform [service 1] and [service 2]. 

**30.** Act as a B2B marketing expert and create a webinar strategy to generate leads for [industry/product]. Outline a speaker plan, funnel, emails, and follow-ups. 

###  **Examples of AI Prompts for Social Media Posts**

Using AI prompts for social media drafts is one of the best decisions I’ve made. AI can draft optimized content for [ each social media platform ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/consumers-favorite-social-channels) , crunch huge datasets to understand what’s working, and write in your tone. You can use AI to keep you consistent while avoiding burnout. 

Let’s look at some examples of social media prompts. 

![ai prompt examples, screenshot of ai-generated social media prompt from hubspot’s breeze](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-7-20250714-2150071.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/artificial-intelligence)

**31.** Suggest design ideas for a 5-slide Instagram carousel for a [product] in [industry]. Here is the draft content for the slides: [content]. 

**32.** Here are some high-performing hooks from previous campaigns: [hooks]. Analyze and create templates for these hooks based on the emotions they evoke. For each topic I sent you next, apply the same template to generate a hook. 

**33.** Write a short-form TikTok video script under 2 minutes for a [product] demo. Use a 3-part structure: Hook → Value/Story → CTA, and include cues for on-screen text and audio suggestions. 

**34.** Here is the transcript of a YouTube video I made for [product]. The video is meant for [target audience]. Based on the transcript, write a compelling video description and suggest tags. 

**35.** Draft an Instagram story sequence to promote a limited-time offer on [product] targeting [audience]. 

**36.** Here are our social media analytics for [duration]: [data]. Please analyze the data and let me know the best posting times, formats, and content patterns.

**40.** Brainstorm [number] UGC content campaign ideas for [product]. Each idea should center around creative ways to showcase the product. Add guidelines, briefs, and incentive structure. 

###  **Examples of AI Prompts for Podcast or Video Content**

Video creation has many moving pieces: scripts, equipment, talent, and post-production. AI can help you with each step of this process if you prompt it correctly. 

Below are the prompts you can use for podcasts or other types of video content. I’m also seeing [ AI-generated videos ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/top-types-of-ai-generated-content-in-marketing) using Veo-3 getting popular, so I’ve included those prompts as well. 

**41.** Generate [number] podcast episode ideas for [product] in the [industry] targeting [audience]. Include a proposed title and a short outline. 

**42.** Suggest a YouTube series on how [product] helps [audience] solve [specific pain point] in the [industry]. The series should be informational with product integrations.

**45.** Create an animated explainer video script for [product] that simplifies [complex concept] for [audience]. 

**46** . Generate a Veo-3 prompt for a film-style video for the first scene of the script: [script]. Include scene description, background, main subject, lighting, etc. 

**47.** Generate five video concepts for a product demo showing [product] in [setting]. 

**48.** Here is my YouTube video: [video]. I want this script to be broken down into multiple short-form pieces of content. Each short form should have a clear hook and takeaway for the audience.

**50.** Write a script for a top [number] style video on [topic]. Rank each item based on significance, engagement potential, and [any other criteria]. 

###  **Examples of AI Prompts for Content Promotion**

Distribution has become quite tricky, whether you’re just building out a brand or managing an established one. Audience attention spans are at an all-time low, and feeds are becoming more crowded. 

Creating good content is just the first step. Learning how to package and sell it is the next. Fortunately, AI is a huge timesaver in this process. 

The AI prompts below are designed to help you refine your ideas and write effective, outward-facing promotional content and messages. Let’s take a look. 

**51.** Generate an influencer outreach message to promote [product] in [industry]. Mention their recent post on [topic] and suggest a partnership or review opportunity. 

**52.** Write an X thread that hooks readers with a [pain point], then teases a free resource on [topic] that helps solve it. Use the thread to build trust and subtly introduce [product] as the deeper solution.

**57.** Draft a full GTM launch plan for a [product] in [industry], including messaging, positioning, channel strategy, and a content rollout plan tailored for [audience].

**59.** Develop an internal training outline for sales and support teams on [marketing strategy] about [product]: core messaging, customer personas, objection handling, and content assets. 

**60.** Draft a press release for [product launch] tailored to the tone of [outlet]. Here are the details of the launch: [details]. 

###  **Examples of AI Prompts for Repurposing Content**

I find AI to be quite effective at [ repurposing content. ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/content/content-repurposing-software) With AI, you can reuse and convert valuable content into multiple marketing assets optimized across channels. 

I typically start with a long-form blog post or YouTube script as the source material. Then, I prompt AI to extract key points and write short-form pieces optimized for platforms like Instagram and X. 

Here are some common AI prompts I use while repurposing content. 

![screenshot of ai content repurposing tool](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/ai-prompt-examples-8-20250714-7672190.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://narrato.io/ai/ai-content-repurposing/)

**61.** Use the core ideas from this [whitepaper] into [number] punchy and engaging tweets for [audience]. Make sure the angles are relevant for the X audience. 

**62.** Update this blog using insights from this [market report]. Keep the core ideas but replace stats, tools, and tone to match today’s trends. 

**63.** Split this [old blog post] into [number] pieces of short form for [platform], each focusing on one key insight relevant to [audience]. 

**64.** Repurpose this [old webinar transcript] into a 1,000-word blog post for [audience] on [topic]. 

**65.** Transform this article [URL] on [topic] into a 10‑minute podcast script for [job position] leaders in [industry]. 

**66.** Refresh this [page URL] content to draft copy for a fresh landing page for [product details], with updated descriptions and modern design cues. 

**67.** Break down this [ebook] into a series of LinkedIn posts for [audience] in [industry]. Each post should have a key takeaway and follow best practices for LinkedIn posts. 

**68.** Rewrite these [testimonials] from customers into five engaging Instagram captions for [product]. Use a casual tone and clear CTA. 

**69.** Update this old email campaign: [insert email] into a refreshed version for [season] [year] that feels timely. Create three variations to A/B test performance. 

**70.** Convert this FAQ page for [product] into an educational email sequence for [audience]. 

##  **Use thorough AI prompts for thorough results.**

A good prompt can make or break your entire AI strategy. I’ve tested dozens of variations of the prompts above on real campaigns, refining my query until I struck the right balance. Use them to get a head start on your prompting strategy. 

Need to prompt AI on a topic that we’ve not covered above? While the prompts above should give you a general idea of the principles of prompting, I have a great hack to share with you. 

**Ask your preferred AI to act as a prompt engineer. Then, describe your specific use case and ask it to generate custom prompts based on the prompts above.**

Ready to put all of this into action? Start by documenting your processes and wins, then use that data as context while prompting AI. That’s how you’ll get the most out of these AI prompts.
