#  How I use BANT to qualify prospects [+ expert tips]

Updated:  07/31/25 

I recall the first time I was introduced to the BANT framework. I was enrolled in an online education program designed to train me as a sales development representative. The program was self-paced, allowing us to study the material at our convenience. I made flashcards to assist my memorization, and I came across the word BANT. 

[ ![Free Download: 101 Sales Qualification Questions \[Access Now\]](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e97d6603-b40e-4085-ad55-0074b7351ead.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/e97d6603-b40e-4085-ad55-0074b7351ead)

I immediately remember thinking this one would be easy to retain, as I saw it was not only an acronym but also a framework utilized in qualifying prospects for the sales cycle. I knew BANT would be something I needed to learn and would use often, so I began immersing myself in the model. 

In this post, I will share how to use BANT as your everyday framework to qualify prospects with intention and structure.

##  What is BANT? 

BANT is a method for qualifying prospects at the start of the sales cycle. It lets salespeople determine whether a prospect is a good fit. 

With so many ways to qualify prospects, I consider BANT to be one of the best, if not the best, methods for qualification. Why? Because it provides step-by-step guidance on how to navigate the conversation, giving you a clear plan on what to do when speaking to a prospect. 

As I mentioned, I immediately adopted BANT as a daily framework when I studied and then transitioned into an SDR role. Because I studied BANT in my training program, I was even more prepared to utilize BANT when speaking to prospects in my sales role.

##  What does BANT stand for? 

BANT’s definition is pretty clear cut — so while how you execute on the framework will involve some finesse, creativity, and a sense of how your prospect is responding to your questions, you’ll ultimately need to cover the following aspects: 

  * **B – Budget.** Does the prospect have the budget to buy your product or service? 
  * **A – Authority.** Is the person you’re speaking to the decision-maker? 
  * **N – Need.** Does the prospect have a real need or problem that your product or service can solve? 
  * **T – Timeline.** What’s their timeline for making a decision or implementing a solution? 



![buyers-journey-questions-4-20250602-3152570](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/buyers-journey-questions-4-20250602-3152570.webp?width=650&height=366&name=buyers-journey-questions-4-20250602-3152570.webp)

{  { sgMacro.render_ftSnippet({ header: "How to Use the BANT Sales Framework and Process", content_type: "ordered_list", list: { items : [ "Understand the prospect’s budget beyond the dollar amount. ", "Identify stakeholders in the decision-making process.", "Determine the importance of the problem.", "Prepare a timeline for the sales process.", "Stay informed through multiple channels.", "Use digital tools to track your progress.", "" ] }, paragraph: { content: "" } }) }} 

Now that you are more aware of what BANT is and what it stands for, I want to show you how using the BANT framework can give you more structure and intention within your sales process. 

###  1\. Understand the prospect’s budget beyond the dollar amount. 

Don’t focus on the exact dollar amount within the prospect’s budget, but rather uncover how they spend. 

This was a major hiccup for me when I first implemented BANT in my conversations as an SDR. I would ask, “What is your budget?” and the prospect would respond with a dollar amount that would be out of the price range of the service I was offering. 

Because it was out of the price range, I initially thought the prospect was not qualified. However, after learning to ask more questions that dug into their spending behavior, flexibility, budget source, etc., I realized that those questions opened up the conversation and allowed me to peel back the onion layers. 

**Pro tip:** Uncover budget patterns. Learn how they _usually_ spend money in this area by asking questions like, _“Have you invested in products or services like this before? What did that process look like?”_

![bant expert tip](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/bant%20expert%20tip.webp?width=650&height=369&name=bant%20expert%20tip.webp)

###  2\. Identify stakeholders in the decision-making process. 

When selecting stakeholders, consider a broad range of individuals who are involved in the decision-making process. You are not looking for just one specific person, but for a buying committee. 

As an SDR, one of my key tasks was to identify the key stakeholders who would champion our products. [ Champions are internal advocates ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-champion) who believe in your product or service and are willing to spread the word or promote it to help drive sales forward. To do this, I would conduct research to identify their interest level and any buying signals that correlated with my current product or service. 

**Pro tip:** Identify the buying committee early. Assume it’s more than one person, because it usually is. To uncover who else is involved, ask, “Is there anyone from [xyz department] who’d need to weigh in before you move forward? In addition to identifying your champion, you’ll also need to identify the gatekeepers, influencers, and end-users. 

![Operation-Everest-Bant-3-20250729-6488231](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Operation-Everest-Bant-3-20250729-6488231.webp?width=650&height=369&name=Operation-Everest-Bant-3-20250729-6488231.webp)

###  3\. Determine the importance of the problem. 

When evaluating the problem you’re trying to solve, ensure that you accurately identify its weight. Not all problems are treated equally, so determine whether the problem is urgent, painful, or business-critical. 

As a sales coach, I was introduced to a method for helping prospects identify genuinely urgent issues. For the sake of illustration, consider the example of vitamins or aspirin. Vitamins are beneficial to have, as they help supplement or replenish what your body is lacking. But vitamins are not always needed; typically, if you miss taking a vitamin, you will be okay. 

Now, aspirin, on the other hand, is required to alleviate the pain. People generally don’t take aspirin as a nice-to-have but as a must to take the pain away immediately. This analogy gave me a crystal-clear understanding of the problems my clients faced, which I could alleviate through my services. 

Now your turn: Determine which problems your prospect is facing, and how your company's product or services can help. In this example, severity is one way to determine the importance of the problem. Other factors include its impact, frequency, and priority. 

**Pro** **t** **ip:** Help the prospect understand the cost of doing nothing, as people often underestimate the pain of staying the same. Help them quantify it by asking questions like “What happens if this issue goes unresolved for another 3-6 months?” and “How would that impact your goals?” This will help the prospect see the severity of said problem if left unaddressed. 

![bant expert tip 3](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/bant%20expert%20tip%203.webp)

###  4\. Prepare a timeline for the sales process. 

Next, you are looking to uncover when the prospect plans to take action. When preparing your sales timeline, ensure you are building a roadmap to guide the prospect through their buying journey. 

One way to prepare your timeline is to understand the evaluation stage from the decision-maker's perspective. Knowing where your prospect is in the evaluation stage will save you time and help you understand what’s next for the prospect. 

The evaluation stage typically involves three key areas: 

  * **Exploring options.** If my prospect is just exploring, they are not ready to commit to a purchase. This is similar to when you are browsing a store and the store clerk asks if you need help with anything, and you mention, “I am just looking.” 
  * **Comparing options.** Here, your prospect is interested, but they are looking to see if you can give them the best price, experience, and solution to their problems. 
  * **Prepared to make a decision.** They are done weighing their options, ready to decide, know what they want, and are prepared to sign on the dotted line. 



**Pro tip:** Add a timeframe to the evaluation stage and help your prospect avoid stagnation. For example, you could say, “Other teams in your situation typically complete evaluations within 2-3 weeks. Does that feel realistic on your end?” 

![Operation-Everest-Bant-5-20250729-5620410](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Operation-Everest-Bant-5-20250729-5620410.webp?width=650&height=369&name=Operation-Everest-Bant-5-20250729-5620410.webp)

###  5\. Stay informed through multiple channels. 

There are many ways to stay informed while using the BANT framework. 

####  **Budget**

To stay up-to-date on budget, I recommend checking out LinkedIn hiring updates, press releases, and funding announcements. As a representative, as part of my ICP research, I would read press releases. This is how I stayed up-to-date on the latest changes the company was making, specifically looking for growth signals or funding announcements that could qualify the allocated budget. 

**Pro tip:** [ Crunchbase ](https://www.crunchbase.com/) is a valuable resource for this, as it provides insights into investment, funding, and corporate news for companies. For example, you might see that a prospective company has just raised a Series A. Likely, that means a budget exists for scaling tools. 

####  **Authority**

To stay informed on who holds the authority in your prospective company, I suggest LinkedIn Sales Navigator, company team pages, and articles. 

[ LinkedIn Sales Navigator ](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions) is a platform for discovering mutual connections, influencers, and champions. I would use it while researching decision-makers to contact. It had all the information I needed to work passively at scale while I attended to the active work of cold calling and emailing. 

For example, you learn that the person you're talking to is a manager, but their VP is the real decision-maker. You catch this by seeing a LinkedIn comment on a post about a “new strategy” from the director. 

LinkedIn is also a go-to channel for leveraging authority in BANT, as it enables you to view the titles and reporting structure of the prospect. 

####  **Need**

For this category, I would suggest a company blog, an employee newsletter, product reviews, and industry news as the top places to gather information about new initiatives the company plans to roll out. Reading reviews will help you understand employee pain points and customer complaints. Industry news can highlight market shifts, creating new pain points and needs within BANT to address. For example, maybe you read a blog post about a prospect that is scaling remote teams. This hints they’ll need better onboarding tools. 

I often read product reviews as a representative because I was selling a product or service, and I wanted to know about the issues customers experienced with the company’s product. I would research the company on Google and read reviews. 

**Pro tip:** If you're going to gather employee reviews, consider visiting [ Glassdoor ](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) or [ RepVue ](https://www.repvue.com/) , which both offer in-depth insights from the employee's point of view. 

####  **Timeline**

News alerts, events/conferences, and Google Alerts will give you access to mergers, layoffs, leadership changes, and automated updates on key accounts. Events and conferences often mark the start of a project. 

[ Google Alerts ](https://www.google.com/alerts?hl%3Den-GB) was my go-to strategy again for working passively at scale. When any changes within the prospective company occurred that were aligned as a qualified lead for BANT, I would note it within the CRM and use it as a selling point to reach out while prospecting. 

Additionally, I would be aware of layoffs and understand the sensitivity behind such a massive change, or realize that it wasn’t an ideal time to reach out. 

![how to use the bant sales framework and process](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/how%20to%20use%20the%20bant%20sales%20framework%20and%20process.webp?width=650&height=339&name=how%20to%20use%20the%20bant%20sales%20framework%20and%20process.webp)

###  6\. Use digital tools to track your progress. 

Create a BANT template or scorecard in [ your CRM ](https://www.hubspot.com/crm) **.** Log answers from prospective conversations to Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline fields to keep track them daily. 

As a rep, I was not as structured with the BANT process as I could have been. However, I do think having an organized system in place is vital, especially when you’re having daily prospecting conversations. This could be an intentional way to manage, track, and view the BANT framework within your workflow. 

**Pro tip:** Create dropdowns or color-coded fields and label them as: Qualified, Partially known, and Unknown/Unqualified. 

##  **How NOT to Use BANT**

I don’t think BANT is needed in every prospective conversation. Most of the time, when you are cold calling, there are more misses than hits that don’t warrant a discussion. Therefore, when it comes to using BANT, it must be intentional, structured, and strategized. 

**Earn the right to talk BANT by focusing first on insight, education, and pain discovery. Don’t assume all of this can be done on the first call.**

I would identify semi-qualified prospects to reach out to and add them to my call list for the day. “Semi-qualified” means they looked like they were a target ICP, and that’s it. I would call, and they would say not interested, hang up, or no one would answer. 

Additionally, I would make other calls to those who had met the initial stage of being an ICP. During a conversation, I could determine if they were a good fit for BANT or not and then move them on to the next step, which might warrant another call. Continue to revisit and update BANT throughout the deal cycle. 

**Pro tip:** To use BANT, it doesn’t have to be in one setting or conversation. When making 50-60 calls a day, I would BANT qualify around 10-15. Not every call qualifies for BANT.

##  **BANT Lead Qualification Questions**

We learned earlier that BANT is more than a checklist. This framework helps you discover a lot of important information about a prospect in a short amount of time while also building a relationship with them. The key to making BANT work for you is asking thoughtful questions that flow together in a conversation. 

Below are some of the best questions to ask a prospect for each stage in the BANT framework. Remember, you’re having a conversation, so vary the order and the wording as you need to. 

###  **Budget**

####  **1\. “What do you currently spend on tackling this issue?”**

[ Balázs Keszthelyi ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bkeszthelyi/) , founder and CEO of [ TechnoLynx ](https://www.technolynx.com) , says, "By starting in this way, I can establish a prospect's current budget, providing a benchmark for what future spend will likely be. Ideally, this question also opens up the conversation to help sales understand if a prospect is willing to spend beyond this — based on whether their current solution achieves all that they hope for, or by how much it falls short. 

####  **2\. “We’ve determined that your team is losing X amount per [week, quarter, year] on this problem. How does that compare to the budget you’ve set aside?”**

From my experience, discussing budgets early in the conversation felt uncomfortable. I was providing the prospect with an easy way out if they didn't want to further the discussion, because I hadn’t yet earned the right to speak about the budget during the first call. 

Instead, lead with value. In this case, this question is more effective and demonstrates the financial impact of the problem. The question helps the prospect understand the cost of inaction if they don’t take action now. 

A question like this can help in the BANT process by opening the door to deeper conversations that uncover the urgency, gain a deeper understanding of their problem, and guide them to a solution that moves the deal forward. 

####  **3\. “We estimate that your team could potentially gain X amount per [week, quarter, year] by making this [change, investment]. How does that compare to the budget you’ve set aside?”**

This question is a straightforward way to connect the budget of BANT with the value of your solution. Instead of providing a transactional budget question, this is framed in terms of what the prospect will gain before considering the cost. 

As a representative, this type of question would allow me to take a collaborative approach, where the prospects I had conversations with were thinking beyond the price and more about what’s at stake financially if they delay action. The question provides insight into how they invest, whether a budget has already been allocated, and who may be involved in the financial discussions. 

####  **​​** **4.** **“** **What team’s budget would this tool fall within?”**

As an SDR, I would often encounter prospects who either didn’t know their exact budget or felt uncomfortable disclosing it immediately. But when you frame it as a question about which team or department owns the budget, it shifts the focus from money to structure. 

This helped me identify key players, learn who to loop in next, and assess whether the conversation needs to be elevated to someone in finance, revops, or IT. It’s an effective way to map the buying process while continuing the conversation with curiosity and professionalism. It’s also a smart, low-pressure way to uncover budget ownership without directly asking, “Do you have a budget for this?” which can feel pushy early in a conversation. 

####  **5\. “How much would it cost to build the system by yourself?”**

As a rep, I understood that early conversations can fall flat when you push too hard for dollar amounts too soon. But when you frame the question in terms of the cost of doing it themselves, you spark a different type of response. 

This question positions your solution against the real costs of internal development — not just in terms of money, but also in terms of time, resources, technical expertise, and long-term maintenance. It's a more innovative, consultative approach that aligns better with the buyer journey and keeps the discovery process value-driven rather than salesy. 

####  **6\. “How much would it cost if you haven’t fixed this issue in five years?**

This kind of question helps the prospect quantify the risk and business impact of doing nothing, which naturally leads to a more grounded conversation about what type of investment would make sense to solve it. From experience, I’ve learned that prospects often lack a clear understanding of the long-term costs associated with their problem. 

By stretching the timeline out to five years, you're encouraging them to think strategically, rather than just having a plan in place. In the BANT process, this helps you uncover the budget by creating a value benchmark that they can compare against any solution. 

####  **7\. “How heavily will price factor into your decision?”**

This question goes beyond just asking for a dollar amount — it helps you understand how price-sensitive the prospect is and what weight the budget carries in comparison to other factors, such as value, ease of use, or implementation. 

In real sales conversations, not every prospect will know or share their budget upfront. But by asking how much pricing will influence their final decision, you‘re opening the door to understanding their internal priorities, buying behavior, and whether you’re aligned on value. In my experience, asking this question would help me pass over well-qualified opportunities and avoid wasting time on prospects who are only price shopping. 

####  **8\. Have you identified a budget range for this purchase?”**

I’ve learned that this question isn’t just about getting a number, it’s more about understanding how far along the prospect is in their buying journey and how serious they are about solving the problem. Asking this question early helped me avoid wasting time on leads that weren’t financially ready or aligned with our offerings. 

This question also opens the door for more profound discovery: if they haven’t identified a budget, you can explore what it’s costing them not to solve the problem and help them connect value to investment. 

####  **9\. “What’s the ROI you’re hoping to see?”**

This question shifts the conversation from features and pricing to value and impact, where actual qualification occurs. Rather than just asking if they have a budget, this question invites the prospect to quantify what success looks like for them, whether that’s revenue growth, time saved, headcount reduction, or improved customer experience. 

This type of question helped me build credibility by showing that I’m not just pitching a product — I’m assisting the buyer in thinking strategically about solving a costly or painful problem. 

####  **10\. “What is the impact on your business if you don't solve this issue in the next two years?”**

[ Keszthelyi ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bkeszthelyi/) also says, “In asking questions that focus on business implications, rather than dollar figures, sales teams can learn what a business is truly hoping to achieve from the purchase and how much the current challenge is costing them. Armed with this information, sales can frame pricing details as a saving, rather than an expense, to prospective buyers.” 

####  **11\. “What value do you place on solving [specific issue]?”**

[ Dylan Cleppe ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcleppe/) , co-founder and CEO of [ OneStop Northwest LLC ](https://onestopnw.com) , says, “This rephrases the budget question to focus on the value of the solution rather than the cost, indirectly revealing their spending capacity. 

For example, when consulting for project management software pricing, discussing the value of streamlined operations and cost savings led clients to voluntarily disclose budget limitations, allowing us to tailor our offerings.” 

###  **Authority**

####  **12\. “Who will be using the product?”**

From my experience, this question helped me uncover both the end users and the influencers in the buying process, which can often be just as important as the final decision-maker. 

Understanding who will use the solution provides insight into how the product will impact day-to-day operations, what pain points it needs to address, and which teams or individuals might advocate for or against the purchase. 

This question can reveal alignment or disconnects between leadership goals and pain points, which is critical in qualifying real urgency and driving the deal forward. 

####  **13\. “When was the last time you bought a similar product? How did the decision-making process go?”**

If the prospect shares that a similar purchase took four months and required sign-off from the CFO, you now have a clearer picture of the potential sales cycle and decision-makers you’ll need to align with. 

From my experience, this question opened the door to understanding not just who was involved in the past, but _how_ decisions are typically made in their organization. On the other hand, if they’ve never bought anything like this before, it suggests that they may need more education, and the timing could be longer or unknown. 

Either way, this question helps you qualify more effectively by understanding authority and timing through a real-world lens, rather than relying on surface-level answers. 

####  **14\. “This is usually the stage where my customer brings in [the head of finance, the other stakeholders, their manager] to [discuss X, get their perspective on Y]. Do you want to invite [Z person/people] to our next meeting?”**

This phrasing positions you as a helpful guide, demonstrating that you understand the typical buying process and think ahead on their behalf. It also creates a natural opening to reveal who else is involved in the decision. In my role as an SDR, I found that involving the right people early on helps keep deals from stalling later. 

This question not only helps surface the full buying committee but also allows you to loop others in while still maintaining a professional approach. It builds credibility, reduces friction, and ensures that you’re a qualified authority, understanding the buyer’s journey, which is precisely what good BANT discovery should do. 

####  **15\. “Will anyone else be involved in this decision?”**

By asking this question, you’re not only identifying additional stakeholders (such as a VP, CFO, or legal), but you’re also setting yourself up for a smoother sales process. 

In my experience, I quickly found out that the person you’re speaking with might not be the final decision-maker, even if they appear to be showing interest or engaging deeply. Understanding this helped me avoid being stuck selling to someone who couldn’t afford to buy. 

This question opens the door for more profound discovery of who signs off, who influences, and who might block the deal later. 

####  **16\. “Can you help me understand how decisions like these are typically made within your organization?”**

[ Cleppe ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcleppe/) also says, “This opens up a broader conversation about the decision-making process and hierarchy, without directly asking about their personal decision-making power. In the context of streamlining business operations, such a question helped identify all stakeholders early on, making subsequent discussions more targeted and efficient.” 

###  **Need**

####  **17\. “When did you identify [problem, opportunity]?”**

This question helps me understand not only what the problem is, but also how long it has been affecting the prospect’s business, and how urgent it is to solve it. This proved crucial when I was a rep. Knowing when the problem was first recognized provides insight into whether the pain is recent and driving immediate action, or if it’s a long-standing issue that might require more nurturing and education. 

This question also helps gauge where they are in their buying journey. Knowing this information can help tailor your outreach and conversations, prioritize follow-ups, and better align with their internal decision-making timeline, ultimately increasing the chance of moving the deal forward efficiently. 

####  **18\. “What prompted you to seek a solution now?”**

[ Cleppe ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcleppe/) says, "Instead of _‘What do you need?’_ I find this question reveals deeper insights into their pain points and urgency. This approach was beneficial when discussing SEO management with clients, as it allowed them to express their challenges and objectives, enabling me to align our services more closely with their actual needs." 

####  **19\. “What steps have you already taken to address it?”**

This question helps uncover the urgency and reality of the pain point by revealing whether they’ve tried to address it before or if it’s a new challenge. If they’ve already taken action, it shows the problem matters enough to invest time and resources, which signals higher buying intent. 

It also helps you identify potential obstacles or reasons previous solutions didn’t work, giving you valuable insight to position your offering as a better fit. Using this type of question as a representative, I was able to learn about their past attempts, which helped me gauge the prospect’s openness to change and readiness to engage, both crucial factors for prioritizing leads and tailoring messaging. 

####  **20\. “How** **important is addressing this to your personal goals at [company]?”**

From my SDR experience, prospects who tie the solution to their own goals tend to be more engaged and proactive, which means the qualification is stronger and the likelihood of closing improves. 

This question helps turn unknown business problems into real, actionable priorities that motivate timely decisions. It goes beyond understanding the company’s problem because it helps uncover the personal stake the prospect has in solving it. When a buyer feels personally invested, they’re more likely to advocate for budget approval and move the deal forward. 

####  **21\. “What are your top priorities at the moment? How do they fit within your team's goals?”**

From my experience, asking this type of question helped me understand if the pain I solve is currently urgent or a “nice to have.” It also reveals internal alignment: if their priorities align with those of the larger team, it’s more likely to garner buy-in and momentum. 

It also gives you insight into whether they’re just exploring or actively solving the problem, which informs the timeline. Instead of asking, “Do you have a need?” or “When do you plan to buy?” this question helps you guide a deeper conversation that uncovers motivation, urgency, and internal strategic fit — all essential for actual qualification and next-step planning. 

####  **22** **. “What are your team’s goals for the next year?”**

When speaking to prospects as a representative, they weren’t always immediately clear on their pain points, but they’re often eager to discuss their goals. By understanding where the team is headed — whether it’s scaling, improving efficiency, or reducing churn — you can surface underlying needs that might not have been articulated yet. 

These goals also provide clues about timing, budget, and potential decision-makers. It‘s not about pitching too soon; it’s about listening for alignment. 

####  **23\. “What happens to your team’s goals if you don’t address this need?”**

I know that buyers often recognize a problem but haven’t fully evaluated the cost of doing nothing, based on my sales experience. By getting them to think about what’s at risk — whether it’s missed revenue targets, team inefficiencies, or stalled growth — you not only validate the need, but you also help create momentum for change. 

This approach positions you as a problem-solver, not just a seller, and makes it easier to transition into deeper qualification and a business case driven by urgency, already determined. 

####  **24\. “What does success look like for you and your team if you're able to solve this challenge?”**

[ Emily Trevino ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilytrevinoofficial) , co-founder and managing partner of [ Wise Insurance ](https://wisehealthins.com) , says, "The answer [to this question] reveals so much about their priorities, constraints, and decision-making process. 

"For example, I once asked this question to a retail chain that was exploring ways to improve their customer experience. The CEO shared that success would be reducing wait times by 50% during peak hours without increasing costs. This told me the budget was limited, speed and efficiency were crucial needs, and the CEO had the authority to approve a solution that met those needs. 

“Armed with that information, my team was able to craft a tailored proposal that aligned with their definition of success, and we were ultimately able to win their business. Asking the right questions upfront is critical to truly understanding a prospect's needs and avoiding wasted effort. Success means different things to different people, so get clarity on what it means to them.” 

###  **Timing**

####  **25\. “Are there any upcoming events/deadlines that you’d like to have a solution in place by?”**

While prospecting as a representative, this question worked for me because it shifted the conversation from unclear timeframes, such as “maybe next quarter,” to specific, business-driven urgency. 

Deadlines, such as year-end, product launches, hiring surges, or new leadership announcements, often create natural pressure for action. If you can tie your solution to helping them meet those milestones, you've become a strategic partner helping them achieve a goal. 

####  **26\. “Are you planning any [insert relevant project here, i.e., lead generation campaign, major hiring spree, program overhauls, etc.]?”**

Often, prospects don’t openly articulate their pain points or timing unless prompted by a relevant business issue. By asking about upcoming plans, you’re uncovering if there’s a driving force behind their interest — a new goal, pressure from leadership, or a strategic move — which helps you position your solution more effectively and move the conversation toward next steps. 

It also indicates whether this is a genuine opportunity worth pursuing or merely a passive inquiry. For example, if they mention a hiring spree, that could indicate new team onboarding needs, a budget already allocated, and a compressed timeline — three BANT boxes in one. 

####  **27\. What’s your [lead generation, revenue, retention, etc.] goal for [next quarter, half of the year]? Will you be able to meet that goal without some sort of change?”**

This question ties the conversation to a measurable business outcome that your prospect is already focused on. It positions you as someone who understands their world, their pressures, and the results they’re expected to deliver. By linking your solution to their ability (or inability) to hit a key goal, you move the conversation from curiosity to urgency. 

From my experience as an SDR, I realized that uncovering a real need is about helping the prospect realize that “business as usual” wouldn’t get them where they want to go. This kind of forward-looking question also facilitates more profound discovery, as it provides a natural follow-up path to explore timing, budget, and authority once the prospect acknowledges the gap between their goal and their current path. 

####  **28\. “Working backward from the date you gave me, we’d need to finalize our agreement by [earlier date]. Does that sound doable?”**

In my experience, buyers often provide a general goal or implementation date, but that doesn’t always accurately reflect the actual timeline for decision-making. By working backward from their target and proposing a realistic agreement deadline, you can help the prospect consider operational steps they might not have considered, such as internal reviews, decision-maker buy-in, and legal processes. 

This question creates urgency in a consultative manner and helps uncover hidden roadblocks. It also provides a clearer picture of whether their timeline aligns with our sales process. Additionally, it builds trust while serving as a qualified checkpoint to determine if the opportunity is truly sales-ready or requires further nurturing. 

####  **29\. “What milestones or objectives are you targeting in the short term?”**

[ Cleppe ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcleppe/) says, “This question encourages clients to think about their immediate priorities and share actionable timelines, facilitating a smoother planning process for both parties. This question respects their planning process while providing vital information for aligning our services with their schedule.” 

##  **Qualify your leads with BANT.**

When used with structure and intention, BANT isn’t just a prospect qualification tool — it’s a conversation guide. It helps you dig deeper, uncover what matters most, and move opportunities forward with clarity and purpose. 

Modern buying decisions involve multiple stakeholders, and your job is to map the dynamics, not force a one-size-fits-all approach. In today’s sales landscape, you have to earn that part of the conversation by first understanding their world and what’s costing them time, money, and energy. When you do it right, you’re laying the foundation for honest, valuable conversations.
