This is what we call **brand management** . 

Creating a brand is thrilling, but it’s not enough. As your business scales, grows, changes, and succeeds, your brand must follow suit. That’s why we created this guide — to cover the basics of brand management and equip you with the tools you need to manage and maintain a fantastic brand.

##  What is brand management? 

Brand management is the process of managing your brand reputation and improving your audience’s perception of your brand in a way that builds brand awareness, equity, and loyalty. 

While [ branding is the process of building your brand ](/marketing/branding) , **brand management** is the process of monitoring and maintaining it. 

Your brand is a living, breathing thing, which means it’s constantly changing. It’s also very susceptible to external factors like news, trends, and current events. In a world where journalists, influencers, and social media users (just to mention a few) influence virtually every narrative, brand management is how you can take control of your business’s story. It is using your branding and brand assets to communicate value and build loyal relationships with your followers, fans, and customers. 

We’ve discussed in other blog posts how important word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing is in [ retaining and attracting new customers ](/service/customer-acquisition#retention) . While you can’t always control what others say about your brand, strategic brand management is the process of _responding_ to them in a way that elevates your brand and remains true to your core brand values — all while [ remaining consistent across teams and channels ](/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34231/8-businesses-that-nail-social-media-brand-consistency.aspx) . 

For that reason, brand management extends far beyond marketing. Brand management should be intertwined with sales, human resources, and customer service — basically, any department that “touches” your followers, customers, and even potential employees. 

When done successfully, brand management can: 

  * Boost your brand awareness 
  * Allow you to charge more for your products or services 
  * Influence your audience’s purchase decisions 
  * Build customer loyalty 
  * Increase sales 
  * Create happy customers that become brand advocates 



##  Principles of Brand Management 

Brand management is comprised of both tangible and intangible components. We’ll discuss the  tangibles in the following section  . 

The **intangible components** , however, include the principles that help you measure your brand management efforts and achieve those  brand management success indicators that we discussed above  . 

You’ll also note that each of these principles can influence the others on this list. For example, heightened brand awareness can contribute to brand reputation, and increased brand loyalty can affect brand equity. 

###  Brand Awareness 

[ Brand awareness ](/marketing/brand-awareness) is how familiar the general public and your target audience is with your brand. Brand awareness is important because consumers can’t engage with or purchase products or services from your brand if they’re not aware of it. 

###  Brand Equity 

Brand equity is how consumers value your brand based on their experiences, perceptions, and associations. (This concept goes hand-in-hand with _brand valuation_ , which is the commercial value of your brand as perceived by the market.) Brand equity is important because a valuable brand can support higher prices and increase your merit among investors, shareholders, and potential buyers. 

###  Brand Loyalty 

Brand loyalty refers to how consistently your customers and followers engage with and purchase from your brand. While your marketing can’t necessarily influence this, your customer service department can — focusing on satisfaction and relationship-building can bring customers back time and time again. Brand loyalty is important because it creates brand ambassadors who [ do your marketing for you ](https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel) . 

###  Brand Recognition 

Brand recognition is how well a consumer, ideally in your target audience, can recognize your brand — through your logo, tagline, packaging, etc. — _without_ seeing your brand name. This concept goes hand-in-hand with _brand recall_ , which is the ability to think of a brand without seeing or hearing any branding prompts. Brand recognition is important because, by recognizing and recalling your brand, consumers keep your brand top-of-mind and are more likely to choose your brand above the competition. 

###  Brand Reputation 

Brand reputation refers to how the general public and your target audience perceive the character, status, and quality of your brand. Your reputation can be influenced by internal factors (customer service, product quality, etc.) and external factors (customer reviews, WOM marketing, news mentions, etc.). Brand reputation is important because it can be some consumers’ first impression of your brand. 

##  Brand Asset Management 

Your brand assets are the **tangible components** of the brand management process, the parts of your branding that your audience can see, experience, and remember. Brand assets include any piece of your branding or marketing that is seen by the “outside world” — customers, employees, or the general public. 

Brand asset management is the process of crafting and maintaining these tangible elements as well as keeping them consistent throughout your branding. This could look like: 

  * Organizing your brand assets (both digitally and physically) 
  * Creating an accessible digital and/or physical storage system for your brand assets, or  implementing a tool that does this for you 
  * Instructing your team on how to access and use your brand assets 
  * Conducting routine checks for [ brand inconsistencies ](/marketing/brand-inconsistency-sources) and correcting when necessary 



What constitutes a brand asset? Let’s cover the assets you’re likely working with for your business. 

###  Brand Name 

Your brand name is the primary identity of your company. As your other brand assets evolve, your brand name likely won’t ever change. If you haven’t trademarked your brand name, we encourage you to do so. 

By owning the rights to your brand name, you have better leverage over unauthorized use and any competitors who attempt to copy or steal your brand. Check out [ HubSpot’s trademarks ](https://legal.hubspot.com/trademarks) and [ Trademark Usage Guidelines ](https://legal.hubspot.com/tm-usage-guidelines) as an example. 

Your brand name will also likely be reflected in your website domain and social media pages. Keeping these names, identities, and handles consistent will help customers discover and follow your business. 

###  Logo and Color Palette 

Your logo and color palette embody the creative representation of your brand. These assets are important parts of your branding as they tap into [ emotional marketing ](/marketing/emotion-marketing) tactics. If designed properly, they can help you attract and convert customers. 

Pro Tip:  Need a little help choosing a color palette? Our free [ Color Palette Generator ](https://www.hubspot.com/brand-kit-generator/color-palette-generator) can help you choose the right color scheme in seconds. 

###  Typography 

Your typography refers to your fonts and text-based assets and how they’re used in your branding. These guidelines inform any branding or marketing asset that’s designed on behalf of your business, including your website, paid advertising, [ social media posts ](/marketing/10-brands-to-follow-on-social-media) , and more — all the way down to the spacing between the letters. 

###  Graphics 

Your graphics include many different brand assets — basically anything specifically designed for your brand or marketing. These could be used on your digital marketing channels (which we’ll discuss next) or developed as standalone assets, such as external slide decks, letterheads, press releases, or even marketing videos. 

Your brand graphics will likely be utilized by a wide variety of people (from designers to social media marketers to content writers), so they should be well-organized and have clear instructions on how to use them. 

###  Digital Marketing Channels 

Your website, social media, and paid advertising are a few of the most important iterations of your brand. Millions of people access the internet daily, and your digital channels are likely the branding assets the most viewed by potential customers. For this reason, they _must_ reflect your branding, and they _must_ be consistent. 

Also included in this section is your employees’ and executives’ social media accounts, as these are a reflection of your brand and a fantastic marketing opportunity to give your audience an inside look at your company and the opportunity to connect with your brand on a personal level. If your employees desire to use their profiles to market your business, ensure their accounts reflect your brand assets and follow  your style guide  . 

_Note_ : If members of your leadership team also manage a personal brand, chat among your team about how to align (or separate completely) this brand with your business brand. If their brand is connected in any way to your company, it should complement yours. 

###  Packaging 

If your business sells a physical product, your packaging is a critical part of your branding. For some customers (if not most), your packaging might be their first impression of your brand. Also, [ one-third of customers say ](https://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2014/25957/how-product-packaging-affects-buying-decisions-infographic) they make purchase decisions on the packaging itself. 

Your packaging is also the most tangible, experiential way that customers interact with your brand. For that reason, your packaging should reflect your branding — in its design, colors, size, and feel. 

###  Style Guide 

Your style guide is a document that instructs employees, designers, and other businesses on how to use your branding. This is an important brand asset because it informs how all other brand assets should be utilized, designed, printed, and more — all the way down to what size your logo should be and what colors are and aren’t allowed in your marketing materials. 

Not only does this help others create on-brand designs; but it also informs them of how to follow branding guidelines and legal/licensing restrictions. Take a look at [ HubSpot’s Brand Guidelines ](https://www.hubspot.com/style-guide) as an example.

##  A Well-Managed Brand is a Successful One 

Brand management, as auxiliary as it seems, _does_ affect your bottom line.

It’s easy to overlook the impact of consistent, intelligent brand experiences — and brand management can help you provide this for your followers, customers, and brand advocates.
