In this article, you'll learn the benefits of a direct marketing strategy, how it works, and the benefits of leveraging it. 

![](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/assets/component-library/sprocket.svg)

##  What is direct marketing? 

Direct marketing is a form of advertising where organizations communicate directly to their customers through a variety of mediums including text messages, email, websites, online ads, and flyers. This strategy bypasses intermediaries, such as retailers or television commercials and instead goes straight to the consumer. 

##  The Benefits of Direct Marketing 

There are several key benefits to implementing a [ direct marketing strategy ](/marketing/marketing-strategy) : 

  * [ Personalized messaging ](/marketing/data-personalize-marketing-li) : With direct marketing, you can send highly personalized messages to your target market, increasing the likelihood that they'll take action. 
  * **Increased[ ROI ](/marketing/how-to-prove-the-roi-of-your-marketing-slideshare) : ** Because direct marketing is so targeted and specific, it often has a higher ROI than indirect marketing. 
  * **Measurable:** This approach is also measurable, which allow you to gain valuable insights on what worked, what didn't, and what to do in the future. 



##  How to Create a Direct Marketing Strategy 

Now that you know the benefits of direct marketing, it's time to learn how to create a direct marketing strategy. Here are the steps you need to take: 

###  1\. Define your target market. 

Creating a direct [ marketing strategy ](/marketing/marketing-strategy) can be a bit daunting, but step one is always to [ identify your target market ](/sales/target-market) . 

This will help you determine what type of medium to use for your campaign as well as what type of message will resonate. 

Start by asking yourself who your ideal customer is. What are their demographics? What do they like and dislike? What motivates them? 

Keep in mind that your target market shouldn't be everyone. In fact, the more specific you are, the better your strategy will be as it will resonate with a specific type of consumer. 

By narrowing your focus, you can create a stronger connection with your audience and see better results from your marketing efforts. 

Once you have a good understanding of your target market, you can start to craft a marketing strategy that will reach them directly. 

###  2\. Research your competition. 

Once you know who your target market is, it's time to research your competition. This will give you a good starting point for your own campaign. 

See what type of direct marketing campaigns they're running and what's working well for them. 

What are they doing that's working well? What could be improved? Understanding their strengths and weaknesses will help you develop a stronger strategy of your own. 

From there, you can brainstorm how you can make it better. 

###  3\. Choose your direct marketing channels. 

When creating a direct marketing strategy, one of the most important steps is to [ choose the right channels ](/marketing/marketing-channels) . 

There are a variety of options available, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. 

To make the best choice, you'll need to consider your target audience, your budget, and your goals. 

Some common direct marketing channels include: 

  * Email 
  * Social media 
  * Text messages 
  * Websites/landing pages 
  * Print ads (newspapers, magazines) 



One popular option is email marketing. This can be an effective way to reach a large number of people quickly and relatively cheaply. 

However, it can be difficult to stand out in someone's inbox, and there's always the risk that your message will be ignored or deleted. 

Another option is direct mail. This can be a more personal way to reach your target audience, and it can be very effective if done correctly. 

However, it can be more expensive than other methods, and there's no guarantee that your message will be seen. 

Ultimately, the best way to choose direct marketing channels is to experiment with different options and see what works best for your business. 

There's no one-size-fits-all solution, so don't be afraid to try something new. 

###  4\. Develop your offer and create your assets. 

[ Your offer ](/marketing/content-marketing) is what you're promoting to your target market. It could be a discount, a free trial, or something else entirely. 

Whatever it is, make sure it's valuable and relevant to your target market. 

From there, you can move on to creating your assets. 

This is the ad, email, flyer, or other that you'll be using in your campaign. If there's no budget to hire a designer, leverage tools like [ Canva ](http://canva.com) to create a high-quality, on-brand design. 

###  5\. Test, measure, and refine. 

Once you've launched your direct marketing campaign, it's important to test, measure, and refine it to ensure maximum effectiveness. 

Today, direct marketers now have access to a wealth of data that can be used to measure the success of their campaigns. 

By analyzing this data, you can optimize your approach and improve your results. 

You'll want to focus on how many users converted as well as where they dropped off in the conversion path. That could indicate a point of friction that you'll want to address, like a long form, vague copy, or missing CTA. 

##  Direct Marketing Examples 

Here are a few examples of direct marketing in action: 

  * A postcard in the mail from a company offering a discount on their products. 
  * An email from an online retailer with a special offer for subscribers. 
  * A text message from a cell phone company about a new plan. 



As you can see, direct marketing can take many different forms. The important thing is to choose the right medium for your target market and offer them something that they'll find valuable. 

If you're looking for a cost-effective way to reach your target market, direct marketing is a great option. 

With a little planning and creativity, you can create a direct marketing campaign that will generate results.
