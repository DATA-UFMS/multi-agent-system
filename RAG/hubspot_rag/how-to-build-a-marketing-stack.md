Updated:  10/13/22 

What will your marketing team look like six months from now? Or a year from now? How many people will you add? What new tools, systems, and data will you need? 

There are a lot of potential questions you can ask about the future of your business, but there is one certainty: you'll deal with more data, more people, more processes, and more complex problems as you grow. 

But how do you deal with that in your marketing team? That’s where marketing technology, or martech, comes in. By automating tasks and removing obstacles from your team’s workflows, marketing tech empowers your team to waste less time on menial tasks, allowing your business to grow more efficiently. 

[ ![Download Now: HubSpot's Annual State of Marketing Report](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee)

When you put it all together, you get a marketing technology stack: a collection of tools that your team uses to do their best work every day. 

As your team and business scales, it’s important to create a martech stack that streamlines your day-to-day processes. In this post, we’ll go over everything you need to know about martech and how to build a marketing tech stack that will stay with you as you grow your business. 

![](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/assets/component-library/sprocket.svg)

##  What is marketing technology (martech)? 

Marketing technology, or martech, is a term used to describe the software and technology used by marketing teams to attract and retain customers. These tools are time-saving, as they typically streamline and automate processes. They also help marketers analyze the success of their efforts. 

![marketing technology](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Banner%20Ad%20Sizes%20\(1\)-png.png?width=650&name=Banner%20Ad%20Sizes%20\(1\)-png.png)

Marketing technology can be used by any type of marketer — even non-digital marketers. One martech tool is typically used for a different marketing discipline. 

Here are a few examples of disciplines and a martech tool that can be used for them. 

  * [ Search Engine Optimization (SEO) ](/marketing/seo) : A keyword research tool such as [ Moz ](https://moz.com/) is an example of a martech tool for SEO. 
  * [ Content marketing ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing) : A content management platform such as [ Content Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms) can be used for content creation. 
  * [ Social media marketing ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing) : A social management platform such as [ HootSuite ](https://www.hootsuite.com/) is an example of a martech tool for social media marketing. 
  * [ Search Engine Marketing (SEM) ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-engine-marketing) : [ Google Ads ](https://ads.google.com/home/?pli=1) is an example of a martech tool for SEM. 
  * [ Event marketing ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/event-marketing) : A lead collection software [ like the one included in Marketing Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/lead-management) can be used for lead capture during an event. 
  * [ Advertising ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising) : A programmatic ad platform such as [ mediasmart ](https://mediasmart.io/) is an example of a martech tool for advertising. 



Instead of adopting a plethora of different tools, some marketers choose to adopt an all-in-one solution such as [ Marketing Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing?_ga=2.151724089.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) .

###  How is technology used in marketing? 

Technology is used by marketers to execute their marketing campaigns. Marketers use software to [ automate marketing tasks ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation?_ga=2.151724089.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) and collect data so they can get insights related to campaign activity and their impact on customers. 

For example, say that your team spends a significant amount of time emailing customers. The action feels repetitive, and it’s keeping people away from more pressing assignments. You may choose to use an [ email automation software ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email?_ga=2.151724089.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) , so less time is spent sending emails. 

You also want the software you use to [ track data ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?_ga=2.151724089.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) related to those emails, so you gain an understanding of how your users interact with them. 

In brief, marketers use technology to make their jobs easier and understand their levels of success. The technology that marketers use in their campaigns is known as their **marketing tech stack** . 

![](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/assets/component-library/sprocket.svg)

##  What is a martech stack? 

A marketing tech stack is the list of tools that marketers use to execute elements of their marketing campaigns, from lead generation to email marketing, from social media management to search engine optimization. There are thousands of different tools to choose from when creating your marketing tech stack. 

Let’s say that you primarily focus on SEO and paid ads on social media. You would add the following tools to your marketing tech stack: Moz for SEO and HootSuite for social media management. 

Alternatively, you can adopt an all-in-one solution such as [ Marketing Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing?_ga=2.151724089.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) to take care of both your SEO and social media marketing strategies. 

For instance, Marketing Hub’s [ SEO tool ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/seo?_ga=2.151724089.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) will assist you in optimizing your site with its built-in keyword research tools, as well as as-you-type optimization advice while you're creating content. 

![Marketing tech SEO tool from HubSpot](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/marketing-tech-seo-tool.jpeg?width=650&name=marketing-tech-seo-tool.jpeg)

Its [ social media management tool ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox) will take care of everything related to social media — including post creation and audience engagement analytics. You can even reply directly to comments from the tool. 

![Marketing tech social media management tool from HubSpot](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/marketing-tech-social-tool.jpeg?width=650&name=marketing-tech-social-tool.jpeg)

Overall, the technology you choose will help you execute your campaigns from start to finish. 

But with so many to choose from, it can be difficult to build a martech stack that works for your team. Let’s go over how you can build an effective stack. 

##  How to Build a Marketing Tech Stack 

There is no out-of-the-box method for building your martech stack. Your company is unique, and your perfect marketing stack is not going to look exactly like anyone else's. 

This is the time for choosing the right tech tools for your team and setting them up in a way that your future team can use and understand. To do so, take the following steps. 

###  1\. Identify your primary marketing strategies and goals. 

Before ever choosing a martech tool, you’ll need to outline your marketing strategies. It doesn’t have to be complicated, either: you simply need to have an idea of the basic strategies that you want to implement. 

If you already have an established marketing team, take a look at the strategies that are currently in place. This will help you gauge, from the get-go, the types of tools you need. 

Here’s an example. Let’s say that you want to increase organic traffic to your website. The strategy for that would be SEO. Next, you want to capture leads. So you would invest in a website redesign strategy that highlights your calls-to-actions more efficiently. 

Jot these strategies down in a document, then include ideas for possible tools you can use to implement the strategies. If you don’t know which tools you use, simply write that you’ll list them after further research. 

_Example 1_

  * **Goal** : _Increase organic traffic_
  * **Strategy** : _SEO_
  * **Tools** : _To be determined_



_Example 2_

  * **Goal** : _Get more visitors to convert_
  * **Strategy** : _Redesign the website_
  * **Tools** : _To be determined_

###  2\. Survey your team to find out their challenges. 

Next, sit down with your team and find out the challenges they encounter when trying to execute their day-to-day duties. 

What adds more time to their workflow? What makes their job harder? 

While the conversation should be open-ended, try to connect their challenges to your marketing goals. For instance, if you want to increase organic traffic, ask what specifically your team finds challenging when trying to optimize the website. If they say keyword research takes too much time, then you’d know that you’ll need a keyword research tool specifically. 

Jot these challenges down in the same document you’ve already started. Keep it simple — just a sentence or a few bullet points will do. 

_Example 1_

  * **Goal** : _Increase organic traffic_
  * **Strategy** : _SEO_
  * **Challenges** : _Keyword research takes too much time_
  * **Tools** : _Keyword research tool that quickens the process_



_Example 2_

  * **Goal** : _Get more visitors to convert_
  * **Strategy** : _Redesigned website_
  * **Challenges** : _Unable to add CTAs because of the outdated backend system_
  * **Tools** : _A new content management system that allows the team to add CTAs to any page_



###  3\. Establish an estimated budget. 

Building your dream martech stack means nothing if you can’t afford it. As you begin to determine the types of tools you’ll need, think about the funds you’ll allot for them. 

You can go several ways about this. You can determine a budget per tool or per strategy. Alternatively, you can choose a budget overall for the entire team in a yearly, quarterly, or monthly basis. 

Choosing a monthly budget is the best choice for small businesses without a dedicated finance team. Most tools are available on a monthly subscription basis, which makes it easier to drop one if it doesn’t work for the team. 

You can also choose a budget per strategy. For instance, you can decide you’ll invest $200 a month in SEO tools. 

Be sure to take into account the amount of seats you’ll need for the tool, or ensure the team is open to sharing one subscription. Most times, sharing a single subscription will work without a problem, and you can save a significant amount of money. 

###  4\. Research the tools you’ll consider for your martech stack. 

Now that you have your strategies, your tool ideas, and your budget, it’s time to research the actual products you’ll add to your martech stack. If you’re a marketing leader, you can leave this task to individual team members, because they’ll be the ones using the tools. 

It’s helpful to look at product curation posts to get a general idea of the offerings that are out there. For the keyword research challenges in your team, for example, you can look at a list of [ keyword research tools ](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-tools-to-find-long-tail-keywords) . If you’re looking for a new CMS, you should look at [ a list of the best CMS systems ](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-cms-systems) . 

From there, you can investigate pricing, product reviews, and general fit for your team. 

Make a list of the tech tools in a spreadsheet and include pricing and a general description of the product. From there, refine the list until you’ve decided on the tools you want to try out, and be sure to specify whether the tool needs a monthly or yearly subscription. 

###  5\. Consider non-marketing tools to add to your tech stack. 

When we talk about the martech stack, we’re often caught up in marketing-specific tools. But there are a wide range of “general” tools that are useful for a marketing team. 

Project management tools, collaboration platforms, and data sync software solutions are just a few of the products you can consider. Anything that cuts time from a complicated workflow is worth exploring. Google Drive would be an example, and so would [ Asana ](https://asana.com/) . 

Add these products to your martech list, including the pricing and a brief description. 

###  6\. Compile the data that you’ll transfer into the tools. 

After you’ve purchased the tools, it’s time to transfer the data. Already have a list of leads? How about Microsoft Word documents you’d like to import into Google Drive for collaborative editing? 

Compile all of them in folders. Assign a type of data to each team member. For instance, one team member can compile the contacts from a conference. Another team member can compile the current templates you use for your social media posts. Another can compile all of the copy from the website for the website redesign. 

When it’s time to sign up for the tools and adopt them, you can transfer these files and data and more easily pick up where you left off. 

###  7\. Assign one team member to create a workflow per tool. 

Now that it’s time to adopt the martech tools, you don’t want to throw it out to your team without a workflow. That’s an easy way to end up with a subscription that no one is using. 

Assign one team member to explore one specific tool. This team member will jot down workflow steps for using the tool effectively and write a step-by-step tutorial with screenshots. After, schedule a meeting for the team member to carry out a live tutorial. 

Why? You can establish the best way to use the tool without a lot of guesswork. The process will be scattered and haphazard if everyone starts using the tool at once. By having a single uniform process, you can guarantee that every team member is using the tool to its fullest extent. 

###  8\. Analyze the tools’ success and switch solutions if necessary. 

You don’t want to end up with an unused martech stack. Always audit your tools for their success — whether they effectively streamline workflows, automate tasks, and help your team do their work in a better way. 

If not, there’s no shame in cancelling your subscription and going for another solution. Take a look at product curation posts, or research individual tools you may have heard of from other marketing leaders. 

Let’s go over a few tips you should apply when building your martech stack.

##  Martech Stack Tips 

As you build your marketing tech stack, you’ll be pulled in all sorts of different directions. When your business is growing, you’ll be tempted to add more complexity to address urgent gaps. 

We've been there. HubSpot's marketing operations team is all too familiar with the challenge of dealing with more and more as our team grows. 

We've learned a lot along the way — so we gathered insights from HubSpot's resident operations experts to ask what they wish they would have known when growing HubSpot's own marketing tech stack. 

###  1\. Strategy first, technology second. 

As companies grow, it can be tempting to rely on technology to support processes that are still evolving. Usually, this happens when a team adopts powerful tools that have a lot of potential, and they try to mold their systems around it. 

HubSpot's marketing operations team has made this mistake, too, and with an important takeaway: What sets apart truly powerful tech stacks isn't just about the technology. 

"The tools themselves won't make you successful but rather how you use them," explains Kerri Harrington, Marketing Ops Analyst here at HubSpot. 

Harrington has worked closely with HubSpot Partners, consulting many who were in the midst of building their tech stacks. She taught them to think about their tech stack not as the powerhouse behind their systems, but a vehicle to efficiently and effectively execute their strategy. 

If you are still developing your strategy, she says, try drawing out and visualizing your tech stack. This gives you an opportunity to think critically about each tool, the purpose it serves, and where there is any overlap or duplication in your tools. 

###  2\. Keep systems simple. 

Have you heard of the "keep it simple, silly" (KISS) principle? The term, originally coined by an aeronautical engineer in the US Navy, states that simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of user acceptance and interaction. 

The term is used often in software design, for example, where function and instruction creep can make products unmanageable over time. 

How do you prevent this happening in your own company as it continues to grow? Put your current strategy down on paper, and review the value of every stage of your process with your leadership team. Consider what processes could be done more efficiently, and what could be eliminated altogether. 

"The #1 driver of complex business systems is complex business rules," says Mark Metcoff, Director of Marketing Technology at HubSpot. "If you can simplify your [ go-to-market strategy ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gtm-strategy) as much as possible, then regardless of how you structure your systems, you'll be heading in the right direction." 

###  3\. Aim for medium-term solutions. 

In an ideal world, every decision you make about your tech stack today will work seamlessly for your team for years to come. 

In reality, though, you are probably going to change systems a dozen times over the next few years if you continue to scale. You shouldn't worry about picking your forever tech, but do not settle for a tool that will become obsolete in 6 months, either. 

"Aim for the medium-term," Metcoff suggests. "The costs of switching systems has never been lower, thanks to the emergence of more persistent datastores like [ customer data platforms ](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-data-platform-guide) that can underlie front-office facing systems, and [ iPaaS solutions ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ipaas-vendors) that allow you to integrate front-office providers for easy data transfer." 

###  4\. Document everything, and document it well. 

Imagine opening your spice cabinet, ready to cook up a chicken curry, to find that nothing in the cabinet is labeled. Every spice and herb is in the same colored jar, with no ingredient label or expiration date. 

Unless you have a noteworthy sense of smell, this project would not be very easy or enjoyable. 

This is what it's like to step into a new role only to realize that your new team's processes and database have not been properly documented. This is common among growing companies, because as your database grows and your systems evolve, it's easy to end up with a lot of clutter, data integrity issues, and confusion. 

Many will skip right over this — who likes to document? Who has the time to 'waste' a day of innovation to do seemingly admin work? We get it — But for the sake of your future team, make sure you take the time to lay down the right foundation for data architecture. 

"I can't tell you how many times we have to review the history of a change or 'walk through' the last couple of years on a topic," says Maggie Butler, Builder Marketing Team Manager at HubSpot. "It gets really, really hard if no one has documented anything." 

One incredibly valuable resource HubSpot had during one of its growth spurts, she says, was the documentation built by our engineers that detailed in simple language how the logic and code worked. Aim for this level of documentation to be comprehensive across all applications, and easily accessible for everyone on your team. 

In terms of marketing tools, our [ Lead Management ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/lead-management?_ga=2.88631323.1849115590.1603201538-685430046.1603201538) tool embodies the ‘document everything’ mantra. The tool can be used to create a database of all customer information, where you can view chronological timelines of every interaction customers have had with you. 

###  5\. Choose point solutions that serve a single purpose. 

A point solution is a product or service that addresses one very specific need in a marketing organization. Sometimes, you just need a piece of software to do a specific thing really, really well. There's no shame in it. 

The [ data sync software ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/data-sync) included in [ Operations Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/operations) is a great example of this. If you use multiple different apps to execute your marketing strategy, keeping track of customer data from each app can be a tedious process. The data sync tool can integrate with your CRM to streamline this process by syncing customer data from your favorite apps into one up-to-date database. 

But keep in mind that every piece you do add to your infrastructure comes with its own compliance risks, technical challenges, maintenance and upkeep, and general administration. 

"Also look closely at whether or not it needs to be integrated into your tech stack," explains Metcoff. "Sometimes point solutions work just fine in a silo." 

If you have any point solutions in your current stack, think about how it fits into the bigger picture: how does it interact with the rest of your technologies, and what do you need to do to keep it running? 

###  6\. Aim for ease of use, but don't sacrifice the necessities. 

There are a lot of options out there — so don't settle for less than what you need. At the end of the day, you need to choose a system that's easy for your team to pick up and use, but still has the [ power and flexibility you need to get things done ](https://medium.com/@HubSpot/marketers-deserve-enterprise-software-that-doesnt-suck-c5ffaa43a013) . 

The challenge with today's marketing automation tools is that they offer either enterprise-grade power or consumer-grade ease-of-use, but never both. As a result, many still go with the safe bet — overpriced, overly complicated, and under-utilized tools — which translates to spending more time on systems than on your customers.
