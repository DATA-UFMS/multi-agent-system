##  What is influencer marketing? 

With [ influencer marketing ](https://offers.hubspot.com/influencer-marketing-guide) , brands employ online influencers to promote their products or services. 

While a recommendation from a friend or family member is valuable, it's only a one-to-one interaction. But with [ influencers ](/marketing/influencer-marketing-power) , this interaction could happen with hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people. 

Plus, influencers work hard to gain their audience's trust, making their recommendations more persuasive than other forms of advertising. 

For all the reasons above, influencer marketing has become one of the fastest-growing marketing strategies today. So, if you're looking to tap into new audiences online, working with influencers can be a powerful way to do just that. 

##  Types of Influencers 

Influencers fall into different tiers of "celebrity," typically based on their audience size. The three most common types are macro, micro, and nano. Let's take a closer look at each and how to start [ recruiting influencers ](https://impact.com/partnerships/5-dos-and-dont-for-influencer-recruiting/) . 

###  Macro influencers 

Macro influencers are a step down from traditional celebrities and mega-influencers. They have a prominent online presence, commanding anywhere from 100,000 to 1 million followers. In addition, they have a broader audience than micro and nano influencers because they cover a range of topics (instead of niching down). 

###  Micro influencers 

More than half of marketers who invest in influencer marketing work with [ micro-influencers ](/marketing/micro-influencer-marketing) . A micro influencer has between 1,000 to 100,000 followers. Their content typically revolves around a specific topic, passion, or niche, making them respected experts in their field. 

###  Nano influencers 

Nano influencers have the smallest audience of the three, but typically spark the most engagement. These influencers have less than 1,000 followers and operate within a super niche community. They've built an active and loyal community who are susceptible to recommendations. 

Typically, nano influencers work with brands for little to no pay, instead receiving free products in exchange for a review or endorsement on social media. 

Now let's dive into 30+ influencer marketing stats you need to know.
