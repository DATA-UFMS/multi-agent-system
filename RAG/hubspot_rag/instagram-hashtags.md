Instagram hashtags are powerful. They can help your posts reach a target audience, attract followers in your niche, increase engagement, and develop a more positive and recognizable brand image. 

[ ![New Data: Instagram Engagement Report \[Free Download\]](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9)

##  What is an Instagram hashtag? 

A hashtag is a word or short phrase — usually one to three words — that has a pound sign or number sign (#) upfront. Hashtags are used on Instagram and other platforms to categorize posts by topic. 

Instagram hashtags are unique because they’re mostly used for content discovery. Like word-of-mouth in the real world, hashtags can help users explore related posts and find new accounts, trends, or communities. 

Instagram hashtags are also popular with niche audiences for posting targeted content. IG's higher-than-average hashtag limit (30 max) and strong hashtag culture also make hashtags a powerful tool on the platform.

##  Why are hashtags important? 

Hashtags are essentially Instagram's sorting process. Over half of all Instagram accounts have [ 1,000-10,000 followers ](https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-engagement-report) , making it tough for Instagram to deliver the right content efficiently to the right people. 

Hashtags help your post get discovered by viewers most interested in seeing it, making Instagram hashtags an essential part of any social media strategy. 

[ Krystal Wu ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalwu/) , former social media community manager at HubSpot, explains the importance of hashtags this way. 

_"Hashtags are like a funnel. For instance, #marketing is incredibly broad and attracts all types of posts._ _I've_ _found #digitalmarketing or #marketingmotivation gives us a more specific, targeted reach. The audience searching for these hashtags are also trying to narrow their search to what we offer related to marketing, so we're actually reaching more of the right_ _people_ _,”_ Wu says. 

In my view, hashtags are a better way to categorize your posts. They help you reach a target audience, and more importantly, they help your target audience find you. These users are more likely to engage with your post because it’s exactly what they were looking for. 

##  Types of Instagram Hashtags 

Hashtags are highly versatile little pieces of text. They can build a community, make your account more visible, or simply attract like-minded individuals to your account. 

![Types of instagram hashtags](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-1-20240730-1418089.webp)

Before choosing a hashtag for your post, consider the most common types and their categorizations. 

###  Branded Hashtags 

Branded hashtags help you build a community specifically around your [ brand ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding) or business. It can be a slogan, the name of a specific product you offer, or your business name. 

###  Product or Service Hashtags 

Companies use product hashtags for posts related to their product and service offerings. These hashtags are usually general, such as #hairsalon or #knitwear. 

However, I recommend you consider using more niche hashtags to share specific products and services, like #blackhairsalon or #handmadeknits. 

###  Industry Hashtags 

These hashtags are commonly used within your industry or niche. They help connect your content with a broader audience interested in a particular industry or topic. 

For example, if you're a traveling food photographer, you might connect with those industries with hashtags like #foodie, #travelphotography, or #foodphotography. 

###  Trending Hashtags 

These are popular hashtags that are currently trending on Instagram. 

They often relate to daily themes (#tbt, #throwbackthursday), holidays (#DiaDeLosMuertos, #Pride, or #IndependenceDay), or viral topics (#barbiemovie, #budapest23). 

Using these hashtags can help increase the visibility of your content. 

###  Community Hashtags 

These hashtags are great for getting more visibility among other Instagrammers who do what you do. For example, if you’re a knitter, you might post with #knittersofinstagram. 

![example of types of instagram hashtags](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-2-20240730-6162019.webp)

_[ Image Source ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CK4XPbTJlrz/) _

###  Location-Based Hashtags 

These are great for targeting users in a specific area. Think #hairsalonnyc or #atlantabakery. 

###  Campaign Hashtags 

If you’re running a sponsored ad or platform-specific giveaway, you can use a unique hashtag to track campaign activity. 

###  Event Hashtags 

As a company or business owner, you can use these hashtags to contribute to the conversation about a specific event or industry conference, like #SXSW2024 or #CES2024.

Check out these hashtags to find everything from selfies to photos of food to pet pictures to vacation shots. They signal that you’re on Instagram and have something worth sharing. 

![best instagram hashtags for likes and follows](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-6-20240730-7719293.webp)

Users who browse the hashtags are looking to grow their follower base on Instagram, too. Using these hashtags tells users you‘ll engage if they do. 

And in my experience, Instagrammers don’t just use these hashtags to connect with each other. They also use them to gain visibility in IG's Explore section or on popular accounts like @instagood.

##  Best Instagram Hashtags for Companies 

Most brands have one or more hashtags they use to connect. 

If your business is new to Instagram, I suggest creating a list of popular community and industry influencers, then checking out their posts and hashtags. 

Most industry hashtags are simple and easy to remember. 

![best instagram hashtags for companies](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-7-20240730-6534024.webp)

These examples may seem a little on the nose, but they bring millions of eyes to posts with these Instagram hashtags: 

  * #manufacturing 
  * #manufacturer 
  * #brand 
  * #brandidentity 
  * #business 
  * #construction 
  * #career 
  * #transport 
  * #transportation 
  * #clothingbrand 
  * #finance 
  * #accounting 
  * #data 
  * #wfh 
  * #commuter 
  * #coworkers 
  * #corporate 



Companies can also get a boost with inspiring quotes and messaging to help people start the week off right. 

On Instagram, the #motivation hashtag has come to caption anything from a photo of a user after a big gym session, to a computer screen right before he or she gets to work. 

So these hashtags are great for companies, too: 

  * #motivationalquotes 
  * #motivational 
  * #motivationmonday 
  * #motivationalquote 
  * #MotivationalSpeaker 
  * #motivationalmonday 
  * #motivations 
  * #motivationquotes 
  * #lovewhatyoudo 



As you choose Instagram hashtags for your company, I recommend you look at the most popular posts for each hashtag, especially words with more than one meaning. 

For example, if you’re posting for a company that trains plumbers, the hashtag “training” sounds like a natural fit. But if you look at posts with this hashtag, most of the posts are from people in fitness, so you’re less likely to grow your audience with that hashtag. 

##  Top Instagram Hashtags for Individuals 

Instagram users build their photo galleries on good feelings. It's a place for individuals to shine with an amazing getaway, a new hairstyle, or a breath-taking moment. 

Sharing that sunshine with others is sometimes the best way to feel good, whether you‘re using #tbt to share an old photo or #cute to record your pet’s latest antics. 

![best instagram hashtags for individuals ](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-8-20240730-8125893.webp)

Individual Insta hashtags are all about the vibe or emotion your post elicits. 

Pretty scenery, a day at the beach, or a night out with good people are all great occasions for a hashtag. 

So get started tagging your personal posts. Your followers will love it, and you're almost guaranteed dozens of heart emojis in your comments.

**Pro tip:** When using hashtags as an individual on Instagram, I find it most effective to combine a mix of popular, general hashtags to boost visibility, along with more niche, targeted hashtags that resonate with my specific community and content themes. 

It's all about experimenting to find the right balance for your unique personality, interests, and goals on the platform.

In fact, there are [ over one billion #fashion posts on Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fashion/) . 

![best instagram hashtags for fashion](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-11-20240730-1350688.webp)

Whether you're hashtagging images of celebrities, luxury brands, clothes, or makeup, Instagram users who want to add a little glamor to their lives will find you.

##  Best Travel Instagram Hashtags 

Whether you're a professional digital nomad or taking a quick weekend vacation, use hashtags to take your followers with you. 

![best instagram hashtags for travel](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-12-20240730-2864415.webp)

Seasonal hashtags are great hashtags for travelers, too. For example, summertime hashtags are full of Instagram users enjoying hours on the beach or showing off breezy outfits. 

Instagram offers so many different filters to enhance photos that it‘s practically assumed that any picture on Instagram has been edited. 

But if you’re using Instagram to lure travelers to your destination, you want to let the world know that your posts don't need a filter to look fabulous. 

Check out these travel hashtags for more ideas: 

  * #travelgram 
  * #instatravel 
  * #travelphotography 
  * #traveling 
  * #travelling 
  * #travelblogger 
  * #traveler 
  * #traveller

##  Best Photography Instagram Hashtags 

I think Instagram is unique because you‘ll see National Geographic and professional photos next to amateur photographers as you scroll. That’s why photography hashtags are so important. 

![best instagram hashtags for photography ](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-13-20240730-6912874.webp)

To generate likes, comments, and followers, you might post daily content around a common theme or offer a glimpse of your every day. 

Another way to stand out is to use hashtags that connect to your favorite subject matter, like #naturelovers or #portraitphotography. 

I recommend you use photo hashtags like the ones below to make your place among the most noteworthy images on the platform. 

  * #naturephotography 
  * #streetphotography 
  * #portraitphotography 
  * #landscapephotography 
  * #weddingphotography 
  * #blackandwhitephotography

##  Top Trending Instagram Hashtags 

Head to “Search” on the Instagram app for the latest trending hashtags. Below the search bar, there’s a horizontal scrolling list of current trending topics, such as fall nail design, fantasy football, or penguin dance. 

Clicking into this trending content will reveal the hashtags that top accounts use for these topics. 

![best instagram hashtags for trending content](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-15-20240730-1657405.webp)

You can also look to trendsetters in your industry or niche for trending hashtags. 

For example, HubSpot’s [ Instagram Engagement report ](https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-engagement-report) includes a list of the top 50 Instagram accounts by followers. 

Trending hashtags these influencers are using include: 

  * #playeverymoment 
  * #hardestworkersintheroom 
  * #NoPrideNoSport 
  * #exploretogether 
  * #comingsoon 
  * #familyreunion 
  * #healthiswealth 
  * #thisismenow 
  * #buildabiggertable 
  * #foreverclassic 



A glance at these accounts also shows mentions growing in popularity, where an influencer names other influencers, collaborators, or brands in their Instagram content. You can use [ HubSpot’s social media management software ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox) to track mentions, monitor keywords, and more. 

##  Niche Hashtags 

Think about hashtag selection the same way you approach SEO for your blog. 

Choose hashtags that support the themes and community that you want to connect with in your post. 

![best instagram hashtags for niche content](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-16-20240730-5948337.webp)

Doing this will help you find hashtags that support your current audience while also helping new people discover your content. Check out [ this post ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-seo) for more details if you’re new to [ Instagram SEO ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-seo) .

  * #familytime

  * #halloweendecorations 
  * #trusttheprocess 



To find the right niche hashtags for your content, go from big to small in your search. For example, say you're creating a video game inspired by Fortnite. 

Start with broad hashtags like #videogames #videogame #videogamecollector #videogameart. Then, narrow to hashtags in your niche, like #horrorgame, #horrowgameplay, #fortnitecommunity. 

Finally, narrow into the specific topic of your post, look at other accounts in your niche, and check out the hashtags they're using, like #upcominggames or #horrowgamesmonth. 

##  User-Generated Hashtags 

User-generated Instagram posts are some of the most powerful content there is — just ask Beyonce's #beyhive. 

You may already have a campaign, brand awareness, and brand loyalty hashtags, but there are a few more ways you can use hashtags to find and promote content from your users. 

![best instagram hashtags for user-generated content](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-17-20240730-1028738.webp)

[ Reposting ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-repost-on-instagram) is a common function on Instagram that lets you share content from other users, with credit back to the original user. 

You can also use hashtags to tell followers on Instagram that a photo or video inspired you. I think funny, Instagram-worthy memes are a great way to add to user conversations. Try these hashtags to share or repost user-generated content: 

  * #reposted 
  * #reposter 
  * #meme 
  * #dankmemes 
  * #funnymemes 
  * #memesdaily 
  * #edgymemes 
  * #dailymemes 
  * #spicymemes 
  * #memestagram 
  * #memes😂 
  * #memepage 
  * #memelord

##  Hashtags to Retire 

It‘s important to routinely change up and audit the hashtags you’re using to help make sure they stay on-brand and effective. Hashtags to retire are oversaturated with content or shadowbanned and could hurt your content reach.

##  Best Practices for Using Hashtags on Instagram 

Using hashtags on Instagram is relatively simple, but you should adhere to a few rules to get the most out of your hashtagging. 

I’ve compiled best practices under the following frequently asked questions. 

###  How many hashtags can I use on Instagram? 

[ Thirty hashtags ](https://help.instagram.com/351460621611097) are the maximum number you can use. 

According to HubSpot research, the average is [ seven ](https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-engagement-report) , with only 1% of Instagram accounts using all 30 hashtags. You can use more or less depending on your Instagram marketing goals. 

More doesn’t necessarily mean better. [ Instagram recommends ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUV20kxvLgS/) users include no more than three to five hashtags per post. 

###  Should I add hashtags to every Instagram post? 

Yes! Absolutely, you should. 

I suggest you try to choose hashtags that are as short or as niche as possible. 

The less volume of posts a hashtag has, the more likely you’ll be seen by people who follow them. Plus, if the subject matter is highly specific, people are more likely to engage with your post. 

###  All of my posts are similar. Can I use the same hashtags over and over again? 

No. Instagram’s algorithm may penalize you for consistently using the same hashtags, pushing your posts down so they don’t show up for those tags. 

Even more, they might ban your account, because using identical hashtags could make it look like you’re spamming users — or worse — like an Instagram bot. 

![instagram hashtags best practices](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-21-20240730-3301317.webp)

_[ Image Source ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ_l2uNAvpk/) _

I recommend rotating your hashtags to be highly relevant to each post, even if the posts are similar. 

Let’s say that you own a handmade pasta business. If you always use the hashtag #spaghetti but post photos of linguini, macaroni, and penne, Instagram may flag your account, and users won’t engage. 

###  Can I hide the hashtags in a comment? 

Absolutely. You can hide your hashtags in a comment. Instagram doesn’t distinguish between caption hashtags and comment hashtags. 

Simply write your caption as you would. After that, navigate to the published post and leave a comment with your hashtags. They’ll be hidden completely until users navigate to the comment section. 

###  How do I hide hashtags in the caption? 

Don’t want to post the hashtags in a comment? No worries. 

You can hide the hashtags in the caption by either 1) writing a caption that’s more than three lines long or 2) adding three to five line breaks with a punctuation mark. 

To add a line break, place the text cursor at the end of your caption and hit Return. Don’t forget to add either a period, a dash, an asterisk, or a tilde to ensure that the line stays there. 

(If there’s no punctuation, Instagram may treat it as accidental extra space, and delete those line breaks upon publication.) 

###  Are there any hashtags I should avoid using? 

Yes. Instagram maintains a list of banned hashtags. However, they don’t publish this list, and there’s no authoritative source. 

Some are intuitive, such as NSFW and self-harm hashtags, while others, such as #pushups and #mustfollow, aren’t as self-evident. If you have any doubts about your hashtags, be sure to look them up using the app’s Search function. 

If it doesn’t show up, it’s banned. If it does show up, navigate to the hashtag feed and check for a message like this: 

![banned instagram hashtags](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-22-20240730-7703885.webp)

_[ Image Source ](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mustfollow/?hl=en) _

If your prospective hashtag doesn’t have a message like this, you’re all good to go.

##  How to Use Hashtags on Instagram for Business 

  1. Keep your hashtags organized. 
  2. Figure out your magic number. 
  3. Narrow your hashtags. 
  4. Research what other people are hashtagging. 
  5. Test out related hashtags. 
  6. Follow your own hashtag. 
  7. Create a brand campaign hashtag. 



**Pro tip:** Regularly monitor your hashtag performance using Instagram Insights or third-party analytics tools. This will help you identify which hashtags are driving the most engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new hashtags to keep your content fresh and optimized. 

###  1\. Keep your hashtags organized. 

You can use Excel or an Instagram analytics tool to create an efficient hashtag system. If you choose an Excel sheet, you‘ll need to manually keep track of which hashtags you use, how often, and which ones correlate to your most popular posts. 

Over time, you’ll see relationships between certain hashtags and your most popular posts, which can help you decide which hashtags work best for your brand. 

If you have a more advanced social media team, I recommend considering a tool like [ HubSpot Social Media Management ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox) , [ Meltwater ](https://www.meltwater.com/en/products/media-database) , or [ Iconosquare ](https://www.iconosquare.com/) . These tools store top hashtags and offer reports on which hashtags reach the most people. 

Krystal Wu says, “An Excel sheet is the best way to start for smaller businesses with limited budgets. Once you get more advanced, I highly recommend using a tool to track the data. A manual system can get overwhelming when you post three times a day and use about 20 hashtags per post.” 

This [ free social media scheduling template ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar) is a quick way to organize your hashtags. 

![social media scheduling template can help you stay organized](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-23-20240730-2041746.webp)

###  2\. Figure out your magic number. 

Most top brands use seven or fewer hashtags per post, so it‘s easy to assume that’s the magic number for everyone … right? 

Krystal explains that this isn't always the case: She told me HubSpot has been more successful with hashtags ranging in the low 20s. Recent [ HubSpot ](https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-engagement-report) [ research ](https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-engagement-report) says that posts with 11 or more hashtags are the top performers. 

The point is, you can't know how many hashtags work best for you until you start testing. For HubSpot, it took the team several months to find a number that worked best, and during the trial period, they ranged from seven to 30. Give yourself the same flexibility for trial and error. 

###  3\. Narrow your hashtags. 

There are two big reasons more specific, smaller-volume hashtags are better for your brand: First, you can compete in a smaller pool. 

HubSpot, for example, doesn‘t typically use the hashtag #marketing because it’s too broad. If you search #marketing, you'll find pictures of restaurants, inspirational quotes, before-and-after hairstyle pictures, and memes. 

The randomness of #marketing leads me to the second reason specific hashtags are a good idea — as a user, I‘m more likely to find what I need if I search for something specific, and when your business comes up for my specific search request, I’m more likely to be happy with what I found. 

Krystal explains: “Keeping a hashtag close to the interests of your brand really helps. We try to use hashtags tailored for a specific topic and then narrow it down further — for instance, we'd use #SEOTips if our marketing post was mostly about SEO.” 

Think of it this way: #dogs is more popular, but it has a wide demographic. If I search #goldenretrieverpuppies and I find your post, I‘m more likely to engage with it because it’s exactly what I'm looking for. 

###  4\. Research what other people are hashtagging. 

An easy way to generate hashtag ideas, I’ve found, is to list your followers or competitors and research what they're hashtagging on their photos. 

It can also be particularly helpful to research what influencers in your industry are hashtagging — by definition, influencers are people with a large social media following, so they must be doing something right. 

###  5\. Test out related hashtags. 

When you type a hashtag into Instagram's search bar, Instagram shows you related hashtags in the scroll-down menu. 

Instagram also delivers related hashtags on the next page after you click on a hashtag, which is a simple way to create a longer list of hashtags. 

###  6\. Follow your own hashtag. 

Another way to use Instagram hashtags for marketing is to follow your own hashtag. Krystal explains, “On Instagram, I actually follow the hashtag #hubspot so I can find anyone who talks about us and connect with them. As long as your account isn't private, people can find you via the hashtag.” 

Following your hashtag is an effective way to engage with others, talking about your brand and developing better relationships with them. 

###  7\. Create a brand campaign hashtag. 

I think this is the trickiest item on the list, but it can pay off big time if done successfully. Some businesses have successfully attracted followers by creating their own campaign hashtags. To work, a campaign hashtag needs to be funny, clever, or at least memorable. 

Campaign hashtags are particularly useful for promoting a new product or upcoming event or even just inspiring people. Red Bull, for example, encouraged followers to post Red Bull pictures with a [ #putacanonit hashtag ](http://shortyawards.com/7th/putacanonit) (see what I mean about clever?). 

Lululemon, rather than running a more traditional ad campaign, developed a positive connotation for their brand by asking followers to post real, active pictures of themselves with a [ #sweatlife hashtag ](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/908352068/lululemon-athletica/) . 

![best instagram hashtags, #sweatlife example from lululemon](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-24-20240730-4831570.webp)

Now that we‘ve covered the importance of using Instagram hashtags for your business, you might be wondering how to search for Instagram hashtags within the app, or how to use the search function to find related ideas. If you’re unsure of the technical process for hashtag searching, here's how: 

##  How to Search Hashtags on Instagram 

To search hashtags on Instagram, tap the magnifying glass at the bottom of your screen, then tap the search bar at the top. Selecting the “Tags” option will enable you to search hashtags and related hashtags based on their popularity. 

###  1\. Open Instagram and tap the search icon. 

Instagram wants you to use hashtags, making it extremely easy to find the right ones for your post. To start, open the Instagram app on your mobile device and tap the magnifying glass at the bottom of your screen. 

![best instagram hashtags](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-25-20240730-6376415.webp)

###  2\. Tap the search bar at the top of your screen. 

The search screen on your Instagram might first send you to a news feed style page (the Explore page) with suggested content based on topics you've demonstrated an interest in on social media. 

To switch to a hashtag search, tap the search bar at the top of this page, as shown in the screenshot above. 

###  3\. Tap “Tags.” 

Once you've tapped the search bar at the top of your screen, Instagram will give you four options to filter your search. 

Instagram refers to hashtags as simply “Tags,” as shown in the screenshot below. Tap this “Tags” option, then tap the search bar above it, and begin searching topics for which you want to find a trending hashtag. 

You don‘t have to include the pound sign (#) in your search — your results will be the same with or without it — but you’ll need to use this pound sign in your photo’s caption once you choose a hashtag. 

![best instagram hashtags](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/instagram-hashtags-26-20240730-796103.webp)

###  4\. Browse hashtags based on post count and current content. 

Voila! You should see multiple options for hashtags based on your search. 

Browse around at each related hashtag that Instagram suggests for you — you might find that a hashtag with slightly fewer posts includes photos or videos that align with the content you're posting. 

After finding the most relevant hashtags for your account, you’ll be sure to create a winning hashtag strategy. 

##  Use Hashtags on Instagram to Gain More Followers 

Using hashtags is a critical part of a strong [ Instagram marketing strategy ](/marketing/how-to-use-instagram) . 

I learned to tailor them to my content, audience, and goals, using a mix of high-volume, niche, trending, and branded hashtags for maximum reach and engagement. 

Continually testing and optimizing my approach over time proved invaluable. 

Putting these insights into practice helped me gain more followers this year. Constant experimentation and refinement with my hashtag usage really paid off. 

Happy hashtagging!
