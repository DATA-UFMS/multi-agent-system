###  11\. [ Pitchbox ](https://pitchbox.com/)

Pitchbox provides several ways to find prospects and build links. With Blogger Outreach, you can find and contact blogs within your niche to post about your products and services and link to your website. 

You can also use Pitchbox's many templates to execute link building strategies. And if you already have prospects, you can import them into a spreadsheet to be referenced in your campaign.

###  12\. [ HARO ](https://www.helpareporter.com/)

Help A Reporter Out (HARO) is mainly a resource for reporters looking to gather sources; however, it can be a useful link building tool if used correctly. 

I use HARO to secure backlinks in different publications and both small and large media outlets. The New York Times and Mashable, for example, are reachable via HARO. 

All you need to do to see the benefits is sign up to be a source on the platform. 

You‘ll then receive email requests from journalists needing your expertise or information, which you can offer, and they’ll typically link to your website in their content.

###  13\. [ Moz Link Explorer ](https://moz.com/link-explorer)

This tool from Moz is an excellent way to stay competitive. All you have to do is enter the URL of the website or page you want link data for. Then, you can see all of their backlinks and receive metrics, like the site's domain authority. 

![link building tools, moz](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/link%20building%20tools%2c%20moz.webp?width=650&height=221&name=link%20building%20tools%2c%20moz.webp)

###  14\. [ Majestic ](https://majestic.com/)

Majestic offers information regarding the number of backlinks a website has, referring domains, and anchor text analysis. 

But its standout feature is its Topical Trust Flow, which measures how many links a website has from trusted “seed” websites. 

![link building tools, majestic](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/link%20building%20tools%2c%20majestic.webp?width=650&height=250&name=link%20building%20tools%2c%20majestic.webp)

###  15\. [ Help a B2B Writer ](https://helpab2bwriter.com/)

Help a B2B Writer works the same as HARO, but it's a service for content marketers rather than journalists. As you would on HARO, you register as a source with Help a B2B writer and you get daily emails with source requests. 

You can also select specific categories to get relevant emails that suit your niche. 

![link building tools, help a b2b writer](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/link%20building%20tools%2c%20help%20a%20b2b%20writer.webp?width=650&height=297&name=link%20building%20tools%2c%20help%20a%20b2b%20writer.webp)

##  Link Building Best Practices 

The bare-bones definition of link building is strategically acquiring links pointing back to your website to increase organic rankings and drive referral traffic. 

However, _successful_ link building is more than that — it also means carefully considering where you place your links, the type and format of the links, the links' anchor text, and how diversified the backlink portfolio is. 

I've found these best practices to be practical parts of an overall link building strategy: 

  * **Create excellent content:** The more valuable and engaging your content is, the more likely you can earn coveted spots on popular websites. I always ensure my content is easy to read, with helpful information like stats, quotes, and other trustworthy data. 
  * **Keep links relevant:** The links should also lead back to high-quality and relevant information on your site. Search engines emphasize relevance, which is another reason targeting websites within your industry is important. 



For example, if my site offers professional cleaning services, linking to a site offering cleaning equipment would be more relevant than linking to a sports equipment company. 

  * **Less is more:** I've realized that placing a few links on high-quality sites is much more effective than putting a more significant number of links on suspicious or spammy sites. 



For instance, with the correct social media management tools, you can make the most of your link building software on [ the most visible online platforms ](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics) . It's all about quality over quantity. 

I also recommend diversifying your link portfolio to have a mix of different kinds of links. 

  * **Build relationships:** Popular blogs are quickly becoming where we go for reliable, relevant news for almost any industry. Take advantage of the existing audiences on blogs in your industry by commenting on posts or even guest blogging. Blog comment links won‘t pass any clout, but they will grab the author’s attention. 



If you are adding value, that will make it easier to partner up on content opportunities. Similarly, developing strong ties with industry influencers and reputable authors can help you add well-placed links to your arsenal. 

  * **Aim for resource pages:** One of the more proven link building strategies is to get links included on a popular resource page. Websites often list helpful links and resources for specific topics, such as a recipe page on a food blog centered on a particular restaurant. 



If you have a recipe or related content to share, you can contact the website's author to ask if they could include your links on the page. It can become a home run if it fits the page and your brand well. 

Link building is essential for the success of any online business, which you can measure by the volume of targeted traffic to your website. 

By following proven best practices and investing in the best SEO link building software, you can ensure that traffic and prosperity remain high.
