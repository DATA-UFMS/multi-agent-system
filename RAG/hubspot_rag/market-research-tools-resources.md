Updated:  04/30/24 

Conducting market research pulls details together to help you choose new products or services to launch. They also help identify your audiences and best marketing strategies so you are ready to act without the guesswork. 

Businesses use market research software to minimize risk and make more data-driven choices. 

I own a small business, and by gathering facts and opinions, I can better predict whether new products or features — and for more prominent companies, even locations — will succeed before investing. 

Here are 29 of the best tools for conducting market research, including a few recommendations directly from HubSpot market researchers and bloggers who use them.

##  **Helpful Market Research Tools & Resources **

###  **1.** [ Similarweb ](https://www.similarweb.com/)

![similarweb-1](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/similarweb-1.png?width=650&height=354&name=similarweb-1.png)

[ Image Source ](https://www.similarweb.com/)

Similarweb is probably the highest quality, most well-known, and most _convenient_ way to get and compare traffic information about any website you land on — short of having an expert analyst whispering in your ear, which could get awkward.   
  
Their free suite of products — including the Chrome extension — is worth exploring and gives you useful, high-level information. The deep insights come from taking advantage of their database of real-world information on global website performance gathered over time, which they’ve already been building for over 10 years. They have their finger on the pulse of online business worldwide, from sales to sites to stocks. 

Microsoft, Amazon, and even Google use Similarweb and the insights they provide on other enterprise-level operations down to small businesses. If you want to know how your company stacks up and then initiate a robust research and marketing campaign, these are serious tools that can help you grow. 

**What I like:** One of their add-ons is called App Intelligence, and it can benchmark your growth and track your progress against millions of apps — for both iOS and Android — and provide daily insights on app rankings, engagement, retention, and more. 

[ Pricing: ](https://www.glimpseahead.ai/pricing) Starter plans cost $125 per month paid annually; professional plans cost $333 per month billed annually; team and enterprise plans have custom pricing. 

###  **2.** [ Glimpse ](https://www.glimpseahead.ai/)

**![Glimpse](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Glimpse.png?width=650&height=292&name=Glimpse.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://www.glimpseahead.ai/)

For [ Max Iskiev ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-iskiev-3a13aa109) , market research analyst at HubSpot, one research tool stands out from the rest: Glimpse. 

He told me, “Glimpse is my favorite research tool. It’s quick and easy to use, allowing me to design and launch short surveys for real-time insights on trending topics.” 

Writers for the [ HubSpot Marketing Blog ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing) have also used Glimpse to run short, 100-person surveys for articles (case in point: [ Are Sales Reps Rushing Back to the Office? ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-office-or-remote) ). 

Not only is Glimpse valuable for doing quick pulse-checks on the latest trends, but it also leverages the power of AI for even deeper insights. 

“Glimpse really shines when it comes to open-ended questions, using natural language processing and AI to analyze emotion and sentiment, saving time, and offering invaluable insights,” Iskiev shared. 

**Best for:** Those who can invest in AI tools for their businesses but don’t need a decade’s deep dive like users of Similarweb might. 

[ Pricing: ](https://www.glimpseahead.ai/pricing) Starter Plan - Free; Professional - $500/month; Advanced - $1,000/month; Enterprise - custom pricing.

###  **3.** [ BuzzSumo ](https://buzzsumo.com/resources/)

![buzzsumo](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/buzzsumo.png?width=650&height=467&name=buzzsumo.png)

[ Image Source ](https://buzzsumo.com/resources/)

BuzzSumo offers several highly useful tools that work best as a content research tool for mid-size businesses and up. If you need many ideas for a whole lot of content, BuzzSumo is likely a good fit for your company. 

Their monitoring tools can alert you to new content that relates to your keywords of choice. 

This is smart for writers, content strategists, and those who manage writers _and_ content strategists to stay on top of trends in what consumers want to know more about within your industry — so you’re right there to provide it. 

BuzzSumo also gives you access to reporting tools that stream various sources of information to your dashboard, making it easy to keep up with developments and build visual assets to communicate about them. 

You can find major influencers — worldwide — through BuzzSumo that fit your brand to sponsor and collaborate with. 

Unfortunately, BuzzSumo doesn’t integrate well with Instagram, so you’ll want to focus on influencers that use other social channels unless you’re willing to do IG work on the side. 

**What I like:** Their Chrome extension is a nice addition to their offerings for companies that work with freelancers and remote workers to take the work on the move. 

[ Pricing: ](https://buzzsumo.com/pricing/) Free 30-day trials are available. Content creation plans cost $199 per month; PR and comms plans cost $299 per month; suite plans cost $499 per month; and Enterprise plans cost $999 per month. 

###  **4.** [ Answer the Public ](https://answerthepublic.com/)

![AnswerThePublic](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/AnswerThePublic.jpg?width=650&height=350&name=AnswerThePublic.jpg)

[ Image Source ](https://answerthepublic.com/)

Answer the Public is a sister product to UberSuggest, both being brainchildren of Neil Patel. 

Answer: the Public watches what people are searching for and lets you keep track of how things change over time. By studying the changes, you can be at the front of trends — positive or negative — so you can respond to the changes quickly. 

It’s billed as an excellent tool for public relations professionals to give them a heads-up on how their company is faring in the public eye. 

If you fall on the wrong side of public sentiment, you can be right on top of salvaging the situation and making improvements to regain trust. 

If you’re doing something right and see gains in positive engagement, you know to keep up what you’re doing and may even want to expand upon it. 

Great examples of what organizations have done with information like this include Wendy’s ongoing roasts and savage clapbacks on social media. 

The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation’s hilarious insistence on not bringing mountain lions in the house also nabbed engagement by the truckloads (of corgis). 

**What I like:** I like that Masterclass videos are available. They make sure to include lots of opportunities to learn how to best use their products and get maximum value from the suite. 

[ Pricing: ](https://answerthepublic.com/pricing) Individual plans cost $9 per month; pro plans cost $99 per month; expert plans cost $199 per month. Lifetime Pricing is available. Individual lifetime plans cost $99, pro lifetime plans cost $199; and expert lifetime plans cost $1,990. 

###  5\. [ GrowthBar SEO ](https://www.growthbarseo.com/)

![growth bar](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/growth%20bar.png?width=650&height=418&name=growth%20bar.png)

[ Image Source ](https://www.growthbarseo.com/)

GrowthBar SEO is all-in for AI. If your leadership wants a slice of the AI action at work in the company’s market research, this might be the tool to reach for. 

It uses ChatGPT-4, and the peer-to-peer review site G2 ranked it the #1 AI writing tool for SEO in 2022 and 2023. 

What sets it apart is that the AI writing assistant doesn’t just compile and give word to information it finds online. 

It offers selections of relevant keywords, titles, headings, industry standard word counts, and link suggestions that you can choose from as you move through the outline. 

They also include tools for keyword research, keyword ranking, and information about your keyword competitors. And because Google search is incorporated into the suite, you can do most, if not all, of your writing work on one screen.

You can create a wide range of question types, and other features include the ability to recall answers from previous questions and create logic jumps. 

In a survey, you’d want to collect both demographic and [ psychographic information ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-psychographics-faqs-ht) on your customers to understand their purchasing behaviors and the problems they encounter. 

The goal is to find out if your product is the solution to one of those problems — and whether, before launching, you should add more features or rethink your product positioning strategy. 

**Best for:** I think Typeform is best for product launches that target a younger demographic. 

If you’re targeting C-suite executives at established firms, consider a more formal option, such as SurveyMonkey, or keeping your tone more formal in your questions.

[ Pricing: ](https://www.loop11.com/pricing/) Rapid Insights plans cost $199 monthly or $179 per month, billed annually. Pro plans cost $399 per month or $358 per month, billed annually. Enterprise plans cost $599 per month or $533 per month, billed annually. 

###  **24.** [ Userlytics ](https://www.userlytics.com/)

**![userlytics](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/userlytics.jpg?width=650&height=350&name=userlytics.jpg) **

[ Image Source ](https://www.userlytics.com/)

Like Loop11, Userlytics allows you to test the usability of your website, mobile app, and site prototype. You can target different devices, define a buyer persona, and disqualify participants based on screening questions. 

Testing is based on tasks that your test-takers carry out. They then answer a simple question about the difficulty of the task. You can structure the question in various ways: 

You can leave it open-ended, provide multiple choices, or ask for a rating. Other formats you can use include System Usability Scale (SUS) questions, Net Promoter Score (NPS) questions, and Single Ease Questions (SEQ). 

**What I like:** Userlytics performs both a webcam and a screen recording. You can compare the user’s answers with their reactions on video to understand how they feel when they’re interacting with your assets.

###  **25.** [ NielsenIQ (NIQ) ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/)

**![niq](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/niq.png?width=650&height=338&name=niq.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/)

NielsenIQ (NIQ) is a retail and consumer intelligence consultant that works with you to collect consumer insights, identify the best distribution channels for your product, and create a range of products to address the needs of your target buyers. 

This service helps you look at your product launch from all angles, delivering [ forecasting data ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/solutions/volumetric-forecasting/) that predicts how your sales will perform upon launch. NielsenIQ can also run [ consumer insights surveys ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/solutions/consumer-analytics/) on their list of panelists and partners. 

NIQ now offers a service called Byzzer to help small businesses with fewer resources. It opens a door for market research reporting, in-person events, and consulting at a lower cost than the full NIQ suite. 

**Best for:** I think Byzzer can be a helpful and affordable option for smaller businesses, but because NielsenIQ operates like a consultant and not as a self-service software, it is a better option for established firms with a bigger product launch budget. 

[ Pricing: ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/about-us/contact-us/) Pricing is available on request.

###  **26.** [ Ubersuggest ](https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/overview)

**![ubersuggest-3](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/ubersuggest-3.png?width=650&height=391&name=ubersuggest-3.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/overview)

Don’t be intimidated by the visually text-heavy Ubersuggest. It really is an easy tool for doing keyword and content research. You just input a phrase, and it’ll create a list of keyword suggestions. 

You can also see top-performing articles and pages to better understand the types of content that rank for those keywords. 

This tool is useful for market research because you can see who your top competitors are, how often your product is searched for, and whether there’s enough space in the market for the type of product you’re launching. 

You can also find out the questions your target audience asks in relation to the product. Each of these questions can be turned into an informative blog post that can guide your audience, increase your brand authority, and drive conversions. 

**Pro tip:** If you want a quick look at the results you can get, head to their website and do a search — just know that you only get one glimpse before they make you register. Alternatives to Ubersuggest include [ Moz ](https://moz.com/explorer) , [ Ahrefs ](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer) , and [ SEMRush ](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/keywordoverview/) . 

[ Pricing: ](https://app.neilpatel.com/en/pricing) Free seven-day trials are available for all three tiers. Individual plans cost $29 per month. Business plans cost $49 per month. Enterprise and agency plans cost $99 per month. Add-ons are available at $5 each. Lifetime memberships are also available. 

###  **27.** [ Pew Research Center ](https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/)

**![pew](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/pew.png?width=650&height=374&name=pew.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/)

From economic conditions to political attitudes, social media usage to food science, the Pew Research Center website has loads of free research that you can use to better understand your target markets. 

Be careful with your curiosity, though. It’s a gorgeous trap of interesting information that can drain your day away — but so happily. 

I that Pew Research Center integrates visual data directly into the text — and we’re not talking about a chart or image spliced in. 

The site has hundreds of [ interactive articles ](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/11/06/comparing-views-of-the-us-and-china-in-24-countries/) that allow you to filter and sift through the data for more granular, targeted insights while also making dense information easier to understand. 

Their research topic selection is delightfully vast. Click the top left tab for “ **Research Topics.”** Then, there is a link to their “ **Full Topic List** .” Once there, each topic cluster has a “ **More** ” option. 

**What I like:** As a writer in digital marketing, I am always on the hunt for targeted and nutritious quotes and insights. I love that you have access to what research participants actually had to say below the Pew Research articles. 

It’s a stellar feature for building compelling presentations. The quotes are tagged, too, so you can sort quotes more specifically on various concepts or groups related to the research. 

[ Here’s an example article ](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/03/13/how-people-in-24-countries-think-democracy-can-improve/) — scroll to the _In Their Own Words_ section at the bottom to check it out. 

**Pricing** : Free 

###  **28.** [ SocialMention (Part of BrandMentions) ](https://brandmentions.com/socialmention/)

**![SocialMention-1](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/SocialMention-1.png?width=650&height=255&name=SocialMention-1.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://brandmentions.com/socialmention/)

SocialMention is a part of BrandMentions focused on social media monitoring. The platform helps you understand what your prospective customers are buzzing about online. 

Search for a keyword, and SocialMentions will show you recent social posts that contain that keyword, along with the context of its usage. 

After subscribing to the platform, you’ll also get other metrics such as Reach (how many people view the keyword per day), Performance (how many people engage with the keyword per day), and Mentions by Weekday (when people mention the keyword). 

One way to use this tool for market research is by finding out what time of day or night people are looking for your product on social media sites. 

Let’s say you’ve developed a sleeping aid app and learn through SocialMention that most people look for sleeping aid apps at 2:00 AM. When you start announcing your product, you will need to schedule your post around 2:00 AM. 

**Pro tip:** Another useful tool you’ll have access to is sentiment analysis on your keywords. It allows you to find out how people are generally feeling about the type of product you’re launching. 

That way, you can refine the tone of your campaigns. 

[ Pricing: ](https://brandmentions.com/pricing.php) Growing business plans cost $79 per month. Company plans cost $249 per month. Enterprise and agency plans cost $399 per month. All prices are billed annually. 

###  **29.** [ Qualtrics Market Research Panels ](https://www.qualtrics.com/research-services/online-sample/)

**![qualtrics](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/qualtrics.png?width=650&height=311&name=qualtrics.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://www.qualtrics.com/frontline/digital/)

Qualtrics takes away the hassle of finding respondents for your market research surveys. They provide an online sample service so you can access real, live human thoughts without having to actually manage any humans. 

It’s an introverted marketer’s dream come true! 

Once you’ve identified your target audience, head on over to Qualtrics and sign up to access a representative sample. 

You can then use [ Qualtrics’ built-in platform ](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/core-xm/) to start gathering insights and information from the people whose pain points you might be able to help solve. 

**Pro tip:** You can actually choose between Qualtrics’ built-in platform or using your own chosen [ survey software ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/service/customer-feedback) . Sometimes, you’re already familiar and comfy with one system or need to hustle with a program you know — Qualtrics lets you pick. 

[ Pricing: ](https://www.qualtrics.com/pricing/) Pricing is available on request. 

###  **30.** [ ProProfs Qualaroo ](https://qualaroo.com/)

**![proprofs](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/proprofs.png?width=650&height=315&name=proprofs.png) **

[ Image Source ](https://qualaroo.com/)

Qualaroo is an advanced user and market research tool that helps you understand your specific market with targeted surveys. 

You can run surveys on over six channels at once — such as website, app, product, social media, and email — to get a 360-degree view of your existing and potential customers. 

It comes packed with features like question branching, 12+ answer types, automatic survey language translation, in-depth audience targeting, pre-built survey templates, and an extensive repository of professionally designed questions. 

You can create various market research surveys in minutes to collect data on the demographic, psychographic, and behavioral traits of your target audience. 

It can help you map customers’ expectations and preferences, create customer personas, and perform audience segmentation. 

Qualaroo also promotes quick feedback analysis. Its in-built AI-based sentiment analysis and text analytics engine automatically categorizes the responses based on user moods. 

It also highlights the key phrases and words in real time, saving hours of manual work. 

**What we like:** In my experience, you can get an awful lot done with just this one source for conducting market research. I like it for its rare combination of tool inclusivity and affordable pricing — it’s definitely a solid source to start with. 

[ Pricing: ](https://qualaroo.com/pricing/) Omni channel plans for up to 50 responses are free. Omni channel plans for businesses up to 100 responses cost $19.99 per month, billed annually. Email surveys up to 50 responses are free. 

Email surveys for businesses up to 100 responses cost $9.99 per month, billed annually. 

##  **Conduct Market Research for a Successful Product Launch**

Conducting market research is essential to a successful product launch to market. 

Although not necessarily a tool per se, HubSpot’s [ root cause analysis (RCA) template  ](//www.hubspot.com/business-templates/root-cause-analysis-template?hubs_post-cta=EN-blog-new) offers the framework needed to spot and prevent any potential underlying issues that have a direct negative impact on your business. 

If you’re not familiar with RCA, it’s essentially a method that aims to identify and fix the primary cause of specific issues — rather than just treating its surface-level effects. 

With the tools I’ve just introduced you to, you can find out who’s looking for your product, why they need it, and how you can better market whatever you’re looking to launch.
