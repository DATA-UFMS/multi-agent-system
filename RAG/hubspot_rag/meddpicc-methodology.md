#  Inside the MEDDPICC Methodology — Insights From the Sales Pros Who Use It

Updated:  02/14/25 

MEDDPICC is a game-changing B2B sales qualification framework. It will help you decide which leads to invest your time into and which leads don’t help you achieve your business goals or may not convert. This way, you can focus your time on the most fulfilling leads that feel like the right fit for your business and motivate you and the sales team. 

Sounds like the dream, doesn’t it? And it is! 

[ ![Free Download: Sales Plan Template](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b91f6ffc-9ab7-4b84-ba51-e70672d7796e.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/b91f6ffc-9ab7-4b84-ba51-e70672d7796e)

Learning about qualified leads feels like a turning point in any B2B operation. To begin with, any lead feels like a goal, but over time, if you’re marketing yourself correctly, you should have more leads than you can serve. A healthy pipeline is a goal for most businesses; there’s security if you have more work than you can do now. 

I’ve learned the hard way (hello, burnout) that you simply can’t invest time equally in every prospect, and any prospect you do invest your time into needs to be a qualified lead that you can — and want — to serve. 

In this article, I’ve deep-dived into the MEDDPICC sales methodology, from what it is and how you can use it, to top tips from seasoned sales pros who use MEDDPICC and describe it as “transformational.” 

I _thoroughly enjoyed_ writing this one. The experts were generous with their examples and tips and incredibly insightful. By the time I’d finished this article, I was already bringing the MEDDPICC sales methodology into my own business. I hope you find it as useful as I did.

##  **What is the MEDDPICC methodology?**

MEDDPICC is a B2B sales qualification framework designed to help salespeople identify and focus on high-potential leads. The goal is to attract more qualified leads and spot a weak lead from a strong one while increasing the chances of closing complex, high-value deals. 

MEDDPICC is an acronym, and it stands for: 

  * Metrics 
  * Economic Buyer 
  * Decision Criteria 
  * Decision Process 
  * Paper Process 
  * Identify Pain 
  * Champion 
  * Competition 



Later in this article, I’ve broken down each component, why it’s important, and how you can use it for sales success. 

![infographic outlines what meddpicc stands for and briefly explains its relevancy to the meddpicc sales process.](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/meddpicc-methodology-2-20250207-9468979.webp)

_[ Source ](https://meddpicc.net/understanding-the-meddpicc-sales-framework/) _

###  MEDDIC vs. MEDDPICC 

The differences between MEDDPICC and [ MEDDIC ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-meddic-sales-qualification-process) are clear. Yes, it’s the addition of the “P” and the extra “C.” 

So, MEDDPICC expands on the MEDDIC framework and includes the: 

  * Paper Process 
  * Competition 



While the core elements are the same, the two serve slightly different purposes. 

MEDDIC might be considered more suitable for shorter sales cycles, smaller businesses, and less competitive markets. 

MEDDPICC is better for longer, more complex sales cycles, larger enterprises, and highly competitive environments. 

![infographic shows the acronym meddic so readers can see the addition of “p” paper process and “c” competitors in the meddpicc sales process.](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/meddpicc-methodology-3-20250207-56671.webp)

_[ Source ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-meddic-sales-qualification-process) _

If you ask me, it can’t hurt to be more thorough and use MEDDPICC as your sales methodology over MEDDIC, no matter how big or small your business and sales cycle. You’ll learn a lot about your business that can be insightful for other departments (not just sales.) 

That said, if you’re overwhelmed, start with MEDDIC.

##  **What are the benefits of MEDDPICC?**

The benefits of MEDDPICC are vast! I will list some of them below, but if you’re still unsure or looking for something more tangible, keep reading. Later, I’ll share real-life examples from sales professionals using a MEDDPICC sales process and their top tips. 

###  Clarity 

Before you can implement the MEDDPICC sales methodology, you need to establish an understanding of what you’re selling, who you're selling it to, why it’s important to them, and who else you’re up against when it comes to sealing the deal. 

Through the MEDDPICC sales process, you will outline answers to these questions, meaning you must think about them properly _._ As a result, all your ideas will be in one place, which is ideal if you’re managing a large team and need everyone working toward the same objective. 

The answers to these questions are covered in the following components. 

  * **Metrics.** Data-driven metrics help guide messaging. 
  * **Economic Buyer.** The person you need to impress so they’ll open the purse to the cash! 
  * **Decision Criteria.** What clients want from you and how they’ll judge you. 
  * **Competition.** Other businesses offering your prospects the same or similar solutions. 



There’s a good chance you have a solid idea of how to address these components of MEDDPICC, but walking through the MEDDPICC sales process forces you to think critically about it. Ideally, you’d discover and settle on answers to these with a team, considering all angles. 

Finally, you gain clarity on precisely who you’re targeting, why, and how you can stand out and win prospects over. 

###  Improved Lead Qualification and Team Morale 

Once your sales process is fully integrated with MEDDPICC, sales personnel will save time and enhance lead quality. They will have the framework to qualify or disqualify opportunities early in the process. 

Teams can focus on high-probability leads instead of spending time on low-quality leads. 

Better quality leads mean more motivation and fulfillment for sales teams. Morale in sales is something that John Rankins talks about in his article [ The Impact of Lead Quality on Your Business ](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/impact-lead-quality-your-business-john-rankins-rhmkf/) . 

Rankins says, “Picture the frustration of your sales team when they continually encounter unqualified leads. It's demotivating to see their hard work result in dead ends. This frustration can lead to burnout, high turnover rates, and a decrease in overall team morale. After all, who wants to make dozens of calls each day, only to be met with rejection or disinterest?” 

If your team is motivated, fulfilled, and excited about their job, then [ sales calls ](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-qualification-questions) will be better, and the customer experience will be enhanced. 

There are no negatives to improving lead quality and empowering sales teams with the knowledge to identify a hot lead from a cold one. 

###  Better Competitive Analysis 

The “Competition” component of MEDDPICC asks you to gain a deeper understanding of competitors' strengths and weaknesses. You’ll need to get real about what competitors do better than you, what you truly excel at, and how you’re going to disarm competitors at every step of the sales process. 

As a consultant, I work with a variety of businesses. Clients have told me, “We don’t have any competitors because…” 

The thing is, unless you’re doing something _completely_ unique and there is no other solution — which seems highly improbable _—_ you’ve got a competitor, and every business benefits greatly from knowing who they are. The MEDDPICC sales process forces you to face this on a deeper level. 

Remember, “Competition” is one of the additions of MEDDPICC compared to MEDDIC. It’s an important component and hugely beneficial to sales and businesses in general. 

**Free Resources:** If you’re just getting started with MEDDPICC, there are resources to help. HubSpot has a [ step-by-step guide to the MEDDIC sales qualification process ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-meddic-sales-qualification-process) and [ 101 sales qualification questions ](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-qualification-questions) .

Here’s a step-by-step guide for each component of the MEDDPICC process, including what each component is and how you can use it to achieve sales success. 

If you love video, I think this one by [ James White ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameswhitesales/) is brilliant. White is a sales growth specialist. In his MEDDPICC video, he explains more about MEDDPICC, the history of this methodology, and works through MEDDPICC step-by-step.

###  Metrics 

Your metrics are the data, or performance indicators, that your buyer most needs. What you want to do is gather the data about how what you do or sell supports or achieves these metrics. 

The thing with metrics, as explained by [ Joel Popoff ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelpopoff/) , CEO of [ Axwell Wallet ](https://www.axwellwallet.com/) , is that you need to turn data into concrete outcomes that actually mean something. 

Popoff says, “Customers connect with concrete outcomes, not abstract data. Rather than emphasizing technical specifications, we offer scenarios like ‘This wallet blocks 99% of RFID skimming threats,’ demonstrating tangible advantages to security-conscious shoppers. This method has considerably increased our conversion rates.” 

###  Economic Buyer 

Your economic buyer is a key player in the MEDDPICC sales methodology. This person has control of budgets and needs to know that the service will perform for the company. You may or may not speak with them directly, but you must understand who this person is and how they can be positively influenced. 

For [ Tyler Hull ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-hull-5b2238158) , founder and sales manager of [ Modern Exterior ](https://modern-exterior.com/) , MEDDPICC’s strength lies in its Metrics _and_ economic buyer components. Hull believes that these metrics “anchor every discussion on specific, quantifiable results and align them with the decision-maker at the top of the budget.” 

Hull explains how this worked: “After introducing MEDDPICC at Modern Exterior, we estimated that our customized solutions reduced clients' project costs by 25% over two years.” 

“We’ve noticed prospects progress much further when they are confident in the numbers we provide to support our propositions.” 

It makes sense. After all, decision-makers need to _know_ that their investment will pay off, and data (or outcomes, as Joel Popoff suggests above) gives them that security. 

###  Decision Criteria 

Your decision criteria are the elements that your buyer will judge you. They will have a list of requirements that they need to meet. The criteria could vary by prospect but include things like cost, implementation, collaboration, product quality, and so much more. 

If you know what criteria you’re judged on, you can make sure you can meet that demand. 

Hull provided insightful examples of decision criteria and how they helped Modern Exterior. “The Decision Criteria component optimized how we sell value, helping us close 15% more deals within six months. In my experience, the framework improves transparency, making it significantly easier to track progress and identify blind spots.” 

###  Decision Process 

Without a framework like MEDDPICC sales methodology, you might make educated guesses about components, like decision-makers or influences in the decision-making process. And in many cases, experience will serve you well, and you’ll be right. 

But, with MEDDPICC, you might uncover incorrect and leading assumptions about who influences the decision process and the weight of some team members. 

[ Edward White ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardjwhiteiii/) is head of growth at [ beehiiv ](https://www.beehiiv.com/) and relies on a MEDDPICC sales process. With MEDDPICC, the team at beehiiv discovered an unexpected influencer. 

White told me: “We found a back-end developer influencing integration decisions, which we’d have missed otherwise. Engaging with them boosted technical alignment and saved us 10+ hours on support post-sale.” 

White’s discovery makes complete sense **.** A backend developer should influence integration decisions since it’s likely the developer who would deal with the integration, if not in the early phases, but certainly once it is live. Any good organization would consult the in-house developer, _but_ , in most cases, developers are not in charge of the budget, may not be on early – or any – sales calls, and are, therefore, easy to forget since they’re not front of mind. 

If you can understand the decision process, you spot potential influencers you need to appease to close a deal. 

###  Paper Process 

The “Paper Process” is the second addition to MEDDPICC (from MEDDIC) and asks teams to understand the paperwork involved in a sale. This includes elements like legal and administrative requirements. 

When I spoke to sales experts about MEDDPICC, one in particular mentioned the paper process. [ Jay Soni ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mj-jay-createfabrics/) , co-founder and director of sales and marketing at [ Yorkshire Fabric Shop ](https://yorkshirefabricshop.com/) , said, “Keep detailed documentation of every step of the MEDDPICC process for each transaction. Exhaustive documentation of the ‘Paper Process’ can reveal potential bottlenecks on contract sign-offs or legal audits and allow your team to mitigate them quickly. Believe me, you’ll be reducing risk and creating predictability with this!” 

###  Identify Pain 

Your product or service should solve a pain point for your customer. If you know exactly what this is, then you can show your prospects how you can alleviate pain. 

[ Jose Angelo ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseangelo100/) is a growth marketer and founder of [ Jose Angelo Studios ](https://joseangelostudios.com/) . He has an impressive example where MEDDPICC implementation increased a sales cycle by 60%. 

Angelo says, “The most successful MEDDPICC implementation I have worked on was for a Fortune 500 technology client.” 

Using MEDDPICC, the client was able to understand who their economic buyer was, the chief revenue officer, and resolve a $2M revenue leak. 

Angelo says, “Structuring the solution directly at their pain points resulted in closing a $400,000 deal within 45 days, or 60% faster than our typical sales cycle.” 

###  Champion 

Your champion is the person who is most invested in you or your company. This is someone who is already supporting you and wants your business to win the deal and have some influence over others within their business. They’re basically an internal salesperson rooting for you. 

The best thing you can do with your champion is esteem them and prepare them with information so they have more persuasion power and may be able to close the deal for you. 

Taylor Hull (mentioned above) has a tip on getting the most out of your champion. He says, “Make the Champion an endpoint, not an extra step. It’s essential that your Champion truly understands the value your solution provides in addressing specific pain points and feels empowered to communicate that value internally.” 

“For instance, providing Champions with personalized ROI breakdowns helped us close 25% more deals, as they had the data needed to influence internal stakeholders effectively.” 

###  Competition 

Competition is the final “C” in MEDDPICC. I think of this one as _highly_ important, but then I do a lot of competitive research in my day-to-day at work. However, it’s no coincidence that competition was a new component enhancing what was MEDDIC. 

In the video shared above, James White advises being careful when discussing competition; bad-mouthing doesn't work, but you can ask your prospects questions. 

White suggests asking: 

  * Who else is involved in the process? 
  * Who are you talking with? 
  * Who are you working with at the moment? 
  * What do you like/dislike about your current solution?

##  **T** **ips for Using MEDDPICC**

I’ve scattered a lot of tips about using MEDDPICC throughout this article, but a few important ones stood out to me, so I listed them here. 

###  1\. Focus on lead qualification. 

Edward White suggests you focus on lead qualification. This was mentioned earlier as a benefit because it saves time and builds morale, but White has a real-life example where lead qualification increased sales success rate. 

White says, “Diving deep into the Decision Criteria stage, we realized creators valued the ease of integration as much as monetization potential. Addressing that upfront increased our onboarding success rate by 15%, saving us hours of back-and-forth clarifications. It’s about solving pain points before they become barriers.” 

**Pro tip:** Use these [ sales qualifications questions ](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-qualification-questions) to help you hone your talking points. 

###  2\. Use it for ecommerce. 

Most think MEDDPICC is just for enterprise sales, but it’s powerful for consumer-focused ecommerce. 

Joel Popoff said, “We utilize [MEDDPICC] to evaluate Decision Process criteria on bulk orders, such as customers buying multiple wallets as gifts. Understanding why buyers prioritize customization possibilities (like laser engraving) has increased our upsell rate by over 20%.” 

###  3\. Demonstrate cost-saving metrics to prospects. 

Jay Soni says MEDDPICC has been the most helpful in mapping out their sales process. 

Soni says, “The “Metrics” aspect has changed the way we engage with potential clients. I recently did a project with an office design firm. We demonstrated how our stain-proof fabrics reduced cleaning costs by £8,000 a year across their portfolio of properties. It was effective. If you can base a sales pitch on real data such as this, then I think it instantly changes the dynamic. We shifted the conversation from opinions to outcomes that we can prove, which helps drive buy-in more quickly from the decision-makers.” 

##  **I’m Using the MEDDPICC Sales Methodology. Are You?**

I loved writing this article on the MEDDPICC sales methodology. I manage sales (though I don’t consider myself a salesperson!) for my B2B business, and at times, sales can be complex with many decision-makers, some of whom I don’t even speak to. 

While some components of the MEDDPICC sales process come naturally to me, I will be making a conscious effort to incorporate the complete MEDDPICC sales process into my business. After writing this article, I see how powerful this methodology is. Plus, I really like how MEDDPICC provides a framework to encourage me to consider each component for each client properly.
