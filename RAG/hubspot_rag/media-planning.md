#  Media planning from the ground up: Everything you need to know

Updated:  05/15/25 

I’ve worked with clients across dozens of industries, and I’ve learned that content only works when it’s planned. You can create brilliant blog posts, scroll-stopping videos, or perfectly-timed X posts, but if it doesn’t fit into a strategy? It disappears. 

No momentum. No message retention. No ROI. 

That’s where media planning comes in. It’s not just about scheduling posts. It’s about making your content work _together_ across channels in a way that builds authority and trust over time. 

[ ![Access Now: Free Media Planning Template](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e)

Because let’s be real: Buyers don’t convert after one blog post. They read your newsletter, scroll past your ad, hear your name on a podcast, and then maybe, just maybe, they click. 

And if you’re not showing up consistently across touchpoints? You’re forgotten. That’s why I always tell clients, strategy beats spontaneity every time. Create less. Plan more. 

In this guide, I’m breaking down what media planning actually means, why it matters, and how to do it in a way that saves time _and_ grows your brand. Plus, I’ve included a [ free media planning template ](https://offers.hubspot.com/paid-media-template) to help you start building your own system. 

Let’s dig in.

##  What is media planning? 

Media planning is the process of deciding what to say, why it matters to your audience, when to say it, and where it should go. That includes choosing the right formats (blog, video, podcast, etc.) and the right channels to increase reach, engagement, conversions, and ROI. 

It sounds simple, but with so many moving parts — timelines, messages, audiences, platforms — it’s easy to fall into reactive posting mode or lose track of what’s actually working. 

That’s where smart media planning steps and simple [ media planning templates ](https://offers.hubspot.com/paid-media-template) come in. They help you get clear, stay consistent, and build content that actually moves the needle.

##  What is a media plan? 

A media plan outlines what kind of content you’ll create and where, when, and how you’ll publish it to engage your audience and drive results. 

Some media plans support larger campaigns or company initiatives, aligning with pre-approved messaging and themes. Others are built to drive always-on content strategies across multiple channels. 

Either way, a good media plan keeps your content focused, intentional, and impactful. 

##  Types of Media Plans 

The best media plan for your brand depends on your goals, your budget, and what you’re offering. But before you choose, you need to understand your options. 

![types of media plans](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/media-planning-1-20250514-8212805.webp?width=550&height=312&name=media-planning-1-20250514-8212805.webp)

###  1\. Continuous Media Plan 

A continuous media plan involves a steady, uninterrupted run of ads over a period of time. 

It works best for non-seasonal products or services that benefit from consistent consumer reminders, such as toothpaste, soap, or subscription services. 

The goal here is to keep your brand top-of-mind year-round through frequent, predictable exposure. 

###  2\. Flighting Media Plan 

A flighting media plan alternates between periods of high ad activity and complete quiet. It is designed for brands with seasonal demand where big moments matter more than constant presence. 

Say you’re selling holiday decorations. You’d go heavy in the weeks leading up to the season, then pause afterward. This approach builds urgency and anticipation when it counts most but it only works if you know your peak periods. 

Use tools like [ HubSpot’s marketing analytics software ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics) to track sales cycles across channels and plan your “flights” for maximum impact. 

[ ![marketing analytics report](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/media-planning-2-20250514-1125110.webp) ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?hubs_post-cta=image)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics)

###  3\. Pulsing Media Plan 

Pulsing combines the best of both worlds: a steady base level of advertising with occasional spikes of higher intensity. You’re always present, but you go big when it matters most. 

I like this approach because (1) it balances budget efficiency with ongoing brand visibility, and (2) it’s flexible. 

You can adapt quickly to changing markets, launches, or unexpected opportunities. 

###  4\. Seasonal Media Plan 

A seasonal media plan zeroes in on specific times of year when your product or service is most relevant. 

It’s built for maximum impact during high-demand periods and it’s cost-effective, too, because you’re only spending when interest is highest. 

A travel company, for example, might lean into winter and summer campaigns, using seasonal themes and promos to drive relevance and resonance. 

###  5\. Roadblock Media Plan 

A roadblock media plan blasts your message across multiple channels _at the same time_ . 

It’s all about making a splash fast. [ Launching a new product ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-launch-checklist) ? Run the same ad across TV, radio, YouTube, and social media to dominate attention in a single day or week. The upside is total visibility and message control. The trade-off is that it takes serious coordination to make it land. 

###  6\. Drip Media Plan 

A drip media plan releases content slowly and steadily like a faucet dripping over time. It’s ideal for long-term nurture campaigns, educational content, or B2B lead gen where trust builds slowly. 

We used this strategy in an email sequence for a B2B software brand sending valuable, tailored messages each week to address specific buyer pain points. Every email added value. Every touchpoint moved the prospect closer to purchase. 

The goal? Stay helpful. Stay consistent. Stay in their mind. 

##  Benefits of Media Planning 

Media planning doesn’t just keep your content organized. It gives your strategy direction, clarity, and power. Here’s how I’ve found it helps me: 

  * Understand your target audience deeply and reach them effectively. 
  * Choose the right media channels and platforms for your message. 
  * Get the timing and frequency right, so content lands when it matters. 
  * Stay on top of trends, tech, and shifts in how media is consumed. 
  * Stick to your budget without compromising content quality. 
  * Measure what works (and what doesn’t) with clean, data-driven analysis. 



##  Media Planning Process 

  1. Conduct market research. 
  2. State your media planning objective. 
  3. Create your media plan using a template. 
  4. Implement your media plan. 
  5. Evaluate your success. 



As you build a media plan, remember that how you apply the insights from each step will depend on your business, audience, and goals. 

No two plans are the same. But the process? That’s consistent. 

Here’s how I start. 

###  1\. Conduct market research. 

Before developing the media plan, I conduct [ market research ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide) to understand who I’m trying to reach. 

I’m not just trying to “reach” someone — I want to resonate. That means creating or updating my [ buyer personas ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research) . These are behavior patterns, decision-making timelines, motivations, and media preferences. 

From there, I look at which channels make sense. Where does my audience actually spend time? What formats do they respond to, such as short-form videos, in-depth blogs, and social carousels? 

The goal is to match the message with the moment. Right content. Right place. Right time. 

For example, if I’m targeting busy ecommerce founders, I’m thinking podcasts during commute hours and email for data insights. TikTok? Probably not. LinkedIn? Definitely. 

Choosing your channels isn’t about being everywhere. It’s about being where it matters.

###  2\. State your media planning objective. 

I always keep one clear goal in mind before building out the rest of the plan. This gives the process structure, and more importantly, it gives me permission to say “no” to the things that don’t align. 

A vague objective leads to scattered efforts. A specific one makes sure you gain traction. Here are a few examples of strong media planning goals: 

  * Strengthen collaboration across teams’ content, design, video, blog, and social so everyone’s working from the same strategy. 
  * Streamline how and when content gets [ published across channels ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution) . 
  * Tighten up distribution timelines to make sure content lands while it’s still fresh and relevant. 
  * Build in enough lead time to actually _analyze_ performance so your next campaign’s even sharper than the last. 



For example, say you’re planning Facebook and Instagram content. Your goal might be to simplify content creation, batch your posts, and schedule them out. 

That way, you’re not scrambling to stay visible. Your posts are already teed up to be relevant, timely, and on-brand.

###  3\. Create your media plan using a template. 

A good media plan doesn’t live in my head or on a scattered thread of Slack messages. 

It lives in a document my whole team can see, edit, and follow. That’s how we stay aligned. That’s how we stay accountable. 

In my experience, the best media plans outline not just _what_ you’re publishing, but _how_ each piece connects to your audience and your goals. 

Written, video, audio, and social content should all ladder up to your core strategy. This is where [ media planning templates ](https://offers.hubspot.com/paid-media-template) come in. 

Templates save time. They cut decision fatigue. And they keep your plan organized, especially if you’re juggling multiple formats or teams. There’s no one-size-fits-all here. The template you use depends on your channels, cadence, and team structure. 

Some brands use multiple templates for different stages like a calendar for scheduling, a checklist for production, and a dashboard for performance. Don’t be afraid to test a few until you find your flow. 

For example, one of HubSpot’s clients was building out a Facebook and Instagram plan. We introduced a simple [ social media calendar template ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar) . It aligned the team, boosted productivity, and significantly improved engagement metrics. 

Bottom line? The right template turns a strategy into action. 

###  4\. Implement your media plan. 

Planning’s great, but implementation is where things get real. 

Make sure everyone involved knows the plan, has access to the tools, and understands their role in the rollout. This is the moment where clarity matters most. 

When we build media plans, we always share the name and contact info of the media planning lead. That way, there’s no confusion. No bottlenecks. If someone has a question, they know exactly who to talk to. 

Let’s go back to that Facebook and Instagram example. 

Once we had the social media calendar template ready, we didn’t just hit “share” and walk away. We made sure the creative team, the publishing team, and even the analytics folks had access and knew how to use it. 

Because a plan only works if it’s visible and usable. 

Give your team the tools and access they need, and implementation will become less chaotic and more effective. 

###  5\. Evaluate your success. 

Whether you’re rolling out a quick social post or a multi-week, cross-channel campaign, success isn’t just about launch. It’s about _learning_ . 

I always take time to pause and ask: Did the plan do what we set out to do? If not, why? Did our tools and templates actually make the process smoother, or did they create friction? 

The way you evaluate success should be directly related to the goals you set in Step 2. Are you seeing more engagement, stronger collaboration across teams, a faster workflow, or clearer data? 

For example: After wrapping up the recent Instagram and Facebook campaign, we didn’t just look at likes and reach. 

We reviewed whether the content calendar helped the team stay aligned, whether our publishing cadence matched audience behavior, and whether those efforts actually moved the needle on business objectives. 

And we always ask: What’s worth repeating? What needs to change next time? 

Because a [ media plan ](https://offers.hubspot.com/paid-media-template) isn’t a one-and-done doc. It’s a living system. The more you evaluate, the sharper it gets. 

##  Media Planning Strategy Components 

There are a few additional things to consider when crafting your media planning strategy. 

First, what's your media planning budget? 

###  Media Planning Budget 

If you’re planning to secure earned media only, skip this part. But if paid placements are on the table, it’s time to talk budget. 

Start by sitting down with your marketing lead or finance team to define your media spend. You want clarity here as this is the number that will shape every decision that follows. 

Lock it in before you start researching platforms or building out content. Nothing stings more than designing a campaign you can’t afford to launch. 

**Pro tip:** Remember the extras. If you plan to expand media coverage later, include the cost of building and distributing media kits. It’s a small line item, but it’s easy to overlook. 

Need inspiration? [ Ramona Sukhraj ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitasukhraj/) , principal marketing manager at HubSpot, curated a collection of [ standout media kits ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-kit-examples) you can use as a benchmark. They’re smart, strategic, and worth a look. 

Once your budget is clear, shift focus to messaging. What exactly do you want your media placements to communicate? 

The budget defines your reach. Messaging defines your impact. Nail both before choosing where to show up. 

###  Media Planning Messaging 

You don’t need to pre-write every headline and caption up front but you _do_ want to lock in your messaging themes early. These themes anchor your entire media presence. Without them, your campaign risks feeling scattered or off-brand. 

Your messaging should come directly from your audience research. What do they care about? What do they need to know? Those insights will shape not just _what_ you say, but _where_ and _how_ you say it. 

So before you pick platforms or brainstorm creative, get your core messages straight. This step informs everything: content types, ad copy, PR angles, influencer briefs, even your media kits. 

Next comes the content itself. This is the stuff you’ll actually publish. 

###  Media Scheduling Strategy 

A solid media scheduling strategy gives you the best of both worlds: space to create content when inspiration hits, and structure to fine-tune your ad strategy when the data says it’s time. 

It saves time, reduces stress, and keeps your content machine humming. However, scheduling isn’t one-size-fits-all. It depends on the type of media you’re working with. 

For organic and paid social posts, timing is everything. You’ve got to show up when your audience is online, even if that’s not convenient for you. 

Tools like [ HubSpot’s social media management platform ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox) can automate the heavy lifting so you don’t have to set alarms for 6 AM post drops. 

Meanwhile, if you’re working on newsletters or blog posts, consistency trumps timing. Show up regularly. That predictability builds trust and anticipation and, over time, a community. 

Here are a few best practices I recommend: 

  * Study your readers and prospects. Know when they’re active and where. 
  * Batch your content. Working ahead avoids last-minute scrambles and keeps frequency stable. 
  * Use the right automation tools. One size doesn’t fit all. Pick the right stack for each channel. 
  * Be consistent. Seriously. Frequency builds familiarity, and familiarity drives results. 



Now that your scheduling foundation is in place, let’s walk through building a media plan. 

##  How to Create a Media Plan 

![how to create a media plan](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/media-planning-4-20250514-8700917.webp)

###  1\. Target your buyer personas. 

You’re not here to market to _everyone_ . You’re here to connect with the right people who are actually interested in what you’re offering. That’s where buyer personas come in. 

A [ buyer persona ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research) is a semi-fictional profile of your ideal customer built on real customer data and market research. Think of it as a cheat sheet for speaking to the right audience on the right platform with the right message. 

When your media plan is built around clear personas, you stop wasting budget and start attracting high-value buyers who convert, stay loyal, and advocate for your brand. 

When I build personas, I focus on a few core traits: 

  * **Demographics.** Age, income, location, identity markers. 
  * **Background.** Career path, job title, lifestyle. 
  * **Identifiers.** How they prefer to communicate, which platforms they live on. 
  * **Goals.** What they want personally and professionally. 
  * **Challenges.** What’s standing in their way. 



The more specific you get, the better your media plan performs. Broad messages miss. Targeted ones stick. 

###  2\. Define your SMART goals. 

Before you build anything, set the goalposts. A media plan without goals is just noise. The [ SMART goal ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template) framework keeps things focused: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. 

Use this model to turn vague ambitions into trackable outcomes. It helps align your team, streamline execution, and gives you a reason to celebrate when you hit your numbers. 

[ How to Set SMART Goals for Your Business (Guide) ](https://youtu.be/9DE5gBCNizA)

Here’s what SMART goal-setting looks like in action: 

  * **Specific.** “We want to generate a greater number of qualified leads.” 
  * **Measurable.** “We want to gain 2,000 followers across X, Metaverse, and Instagram.” 
  * **Attainable.** “Last quarter, we hit 70% customer engagement. This time, we’re aiming for 75%.” 
  * **Relevant.** “We want more engaged followers to strengthen brand reputation and grow advocacy.” 
  * **Time-Bound.** “We’ll hit that 2,000-follower goal in the next three months.” 



Once I set my goals, I reverse-engineer my plan to achieve them. Then, I explore tools and tactics to accelerate my progress.

###  3\. Find the media planning tools best suited for you. 

I’ll share some top-tier media planning templates for your business later in this post, but first let’s look at the software that can do the heavy lifting for you. 

If you’re just getting started, [ HubSpot Marketing Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing) is a solid all-in-one option. It’s built for drafting, scheduling, and tracking conversions, so you can manage the entire planning process in one place. 

And here’s where things get interesting: Some platforms include [ AI media planning ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-media-planning) features that take the guesswork out of media planning. These features help you identify channels likely to perform better, recommend optimal posting times, and even forecast content trends based on historical data. 

That means less trial-and-error and more data-backed decisions, which is helpful when you’re working across multiple formats or audiences. 

Looking for more flexibility? I’ve curated a list of [ 13 essential media planning tools ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning-tools) , from scheduling platforms to analytics dashboards, to help you build, launch, and measure smarter campaigns. 

###  4\. Analyze historical data. 

You can’t move forward without knowing where you’ve been. I always start by reviewing past media plans to assess what worked and what didn’t. 

The goal isn’t just reflection, it’s gathering insights to help you optimize your media plan, messages, and channels to improve engagement and ROI. 

Let’s say your brand is already active on Facebook. I’d head straight to [ Business Page Insights ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-insights) : 

  * How did your old posting schedule perform? 
  * Which posts drove the most engagement? 
  * What time slots brought the most traffic? 
  * And most importantly: What content actually moved people from follower to customer? 



This isn’t just a look back. It’s fuel for what’s next. Take the wins from your last strategy and use them to guide your next move. Build on what worked and leave the rest behind. 

###  5\. Choose your media mix. 

Your media mix should be built on two things: 

  * Current channel performance. 
  * Where your buyer personas actually spend their time. 



According to HubSpot’s [ State of Marketing Report ](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing) , over 1,400 global marketers ranked the top channels by ROI: 

  * Websites and Blogs 
  * Social Media 
  * Email Marketing 
  * Content Marketing 



No surprises there, but remember, this isn’t one-size-fits-all. 

In my experience, an [ omnichannel ](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/omni-channel-experience) media plan delivers the best results. It meets your audience where they already are and creates more touchpoints across the funnel. 

The key? Do the research. Find out where your personas hang out, how they consume content, and what influences their decisions. Then build a mix that reflects that, not just what’s trending. 

Be strategic, flexible, and stay open to testing new platforms when the opportunity’s right. 

###  6\. Put your media plan into action. 

As you roll out your media plan, keep a close eye on performance. Are your insights aligned with your SMART goals? If not, don’t panic, just pivot. 

Marketing is always in motion. What worked last quarter might stall this one. The best media planners adjust fast, based on real data, not assumptions. 

Track, analyze, refine. Then do it again. 

Now that you’ve established the framework, let’s explore the resources that will make your media planning process smoother and more efficient. 

##  Media Planning Templates 

There’s no shortage of media planning templates online both free and paid — and honestly, they’re a huge time-saver. 

What I love most is how flexible they are. You can customize them to fit your business’s goals, tools, and workflow. 

If you’re using platforms like [ HubSpot (free) CRM ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm) , [ Marketing Hub ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing) , or [ Sprout Social ](https://sproutsocial.com/) , chances are they already include built-in planning templates. 

I’ve used HubSpot myself and they offer a [ solid range of options ](https://www.hubspot.com/resources/template) depending on your campaign type and media mix. 

If you prefer to build from scratch, [ Google Sheets ](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) is your friend. I’ve created my own templates this way to lock in a format that mirrors my internal processes. 

It takes a little more upfront work, but the payoff is a system that fits like a glove. 

Whichever route you take, one thing’s key: Your templates should evolve. As your audience grows and your goals shift, your planning tools should keep pace. Don’t be afraid to tweak and refine as you go.

##  Media Plan Examples That Actually Help You Execute 

I’ve talked about media planning. I’ve even shared templates. 

But let’s be honest: putting it into practice is another story. 

That’s why I’m sharing a few sample media plans below. I’ve built these using templates I regularly use with my team and clients so you’re getting examples that are both tactical and easy to implement. 

###  Social Media Plan Example 

Social media can be your biggest asset or your biggest time suck. It’s often the first thing marketers jump into, but it’s also where many get stuck. Too many platforms, not enough strategy. 

Most people waste hours posting where no one’s listening. 

Avoid this by choosing the platforms where your audience actually spends time. If you’re not sure which that is, it’s fine to experiment. What matters is that you test, track, and then double down on what works. 

Run content experiments for a week: Track likes, saves, and click-throughs and then focus on the channel that shows momentum. 

Most people give up because they lack a clear plan. This solves that. 

Here’s a sample social media plan using [ HubSpot’s Social Media Content Calendar Template ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_signup-url%253Dwww.hubspot.com%25252Fresources%25252Ftemplate%2526hubs_signup-cta%253Ddirectories__link%2526q%253Dsocial%25252Bmedia%26hubs_signup-url%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning%26hubs_signup-cta%3DHubSpot%2527s%2520Social%2520Media%2520Content%2520Template%2520to%2520help%2520you%2520explore%2520multiple%2520platforms.%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning%26hubs_post-cta%3DHubSpot%2527s%2520Social%2520Media%2520Content%2520Template%2520to%2520help%2520you%2520explore%2520multiple%2520platforms.%26_ga%3D2.110302725.1617344842.1744359534-1251549952.1744128274%26_gl%3D1*h5jczm*_gcl_au*ODk5ODg2MDEuMTc0NDEyODI3NA..*FPAU*ODk5ODg2MDEuMTc0NDEyODI3NA..*_ga*MTI1MTU0OTk1Mi4xNzQ0MTI4Mjc0*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTc0NDM3MTQ4My44LjEuMTc0NDM3MjYwMC40MC4wLjA.*_fplc*QWhjd29ld29SVmwxOVpLWEpDaWNtdkZKaFZuREphZHolMkZHQXQlMkZZdG41endtV3NYSFBhY2lKZkRGZGI3OFRRTFptbHRiREl5UEk1WFlPWG45MXBMOUYybjNwVVgwemNjbEpVNHRXbkIlMkZGY3l1Y3V4V3dyeTJtWmI2RWlCUXJnJTNEJTNE) to help you explore multiple channels with structure. 

[ ![social calendar, media plan](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/media-planning-6-20250514-5554408.webp) ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_post-cta=image)

[ _Source_ ](https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar)

**Pro** **tip:** Pick one platform to start. Build a one-week content calendar. Track engagement, clicks, and conversions and then iterate. 

###  Blogging Media Plan Example 

Consistency is the game with blogging. 

Not only does publishing regularly help your SEO and brand authority, it also keeps your team aligned. If you manage multiple writers or contributors, you already know how easy it is to lose track of deadlines or follow-ups. 

That’s where a blogging media plan saves you. Here’s a simple example you can adapt using [ HubSpot’s Blog Editorial Calendar ](https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates?hubs_signup-url%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning%26hubs_signup-cta%3Dyou%2520can%2520download%2520from%2520HubSpot%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning%26hubs_post-cta%3Dyou%2520can%2520download%2520from%2520HubSpot%26_ga%3D2.80941847.1617344842.1744359534-1251549952.1744128274%26_gl%3D1*1mvd75k*_gcl_au*ODk5ODg2MDEuMTc0NDEyODI3NA..*FPAU*ODk5ODg2MDEuMTc0NDEyODI3NA..*_ga*MTI1MTU0OTk1Mi4xNzQ0MTI4Mjc0*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTc0NDM3MTQ4My44LjEuMTc0NDM3MjcxMi42MC4wLjA.*_fplc*QWhjd29ld29SVmwxOVpLWEpDaWNtdkZKaFZuREphZHolMkZHQXQlMkZZdG41endtV3NYSFBhY2lKZkRGZGI3OFRRTFptbHRiREl5UEk1WFlPWG45MXBMOUYybjNwVVgwemNjbEpVNHRXbkIlMkZGY3l1Y3V4V3dyeTJtWmI2RWlCUXJnJTNEJTNE) .

PR planning is a little more involved but worth it. 

Coordinating with external publishers and managing long lead times means you need structure. A good PR media plan helps you prioritize key stories, time your outreach, and align internal messaging with your external efforts. 

In the example below, I’ve included just the “Reach Out” and “Content Planning” phases. These are the tactical building blocks. (The full [ PR Media Plan Template from HubSpot ](https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/pr-plan?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning%26hubs_content-cta%3DHubSpot%2520PR%2520Plan%2520template%26hubs_post%3Dblog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning%26hubs_post-cta%3DHubSpot%2520PR%2520Plan%2520template%26_ga%3D2.190977706.1617344842.1744359534-1251549952.1744128274%26_gl%3D1*jgdguc*_gcl_au*ODk5ODg2MDEuMTc0NDEyODI3NA..*FPAU*ODk5ODg2MDEuMTc0NDEyODI3NA..*_ga*MTI1MTU0OTk1Mi4xNzQ0MTI4Mjc0*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTc0NDM3MTQ4My44LjEuMTc0NDM3MzA2MC41NS4wLjA.*_fplc*QWhjd29ld29SVmwxOVpLWEpDaWNtdkZKaFZuREphZHolMkZHQXQlMkZZdG41endtV3NYSFBhY2lKZkRGZGI3OFRRTFptbHRiREl5UEk1WFlPWG45MXBMOUYybjNwVVgwemNjbEpVNHRXbkIlMkZGY3l1Y3V4V3dyeTJtWmI2RWlCUXJnJTNEJTNE) includes budgeting, timelines, and more.) 

Here’s what a basic PR activity table might look like: 

**Activity** |  **Description** |  **Start Date** |  **End Date**  
---|---|---|---  
Guest posts  |  Promote new workout pants  |  3 Mar 2025  |  3 Jun 2025   
Press releases (major outlets)  |  General brand awareness  |  10 Jul 2025  |  20 Dec 2025   
Monthly newsletters  |  Keep audience informed  |  3 Mar 2025  |  29 Dec 2025   
  
Use this to visualize campaign timing and identify overlapping promotions across channels.

###  Bringing It All Together 

Media planning is the foundation. Use the examples above to jumpstart your plan then refine based on performance. 

And remember: These plans work better when connected. Your blog drives traffic to social. Social feeds your PR buzz. Your PR opens the door to backlinks and media coverage. 

It’s all connected. 

Now that we’ve built the plan, let’s talk about media buying because reaching your audience at scale means putting dollars behind your content. 

Let’s dive in. 

##  Media Planning vs. Media Buying 

Digital media planning and [ media buying ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-buying) go hand in hand but they’re not the same thing. 

Depending on your team size and budget, one person might wear both hats. But if you’re scaling your strategy or optimizing for ROI, it’s important to understand what each process entails. 

So what’s the difference? 

![infographic describing the difference between media buying and media planning](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/media-planning-8-20250514-5364171.webp)

Media planning is the strategic process of deciding _what_ content to create, _where_ it will live, and _who_ it’s for. 

That could include organic blog posts, podcast placements, influencer content, or paid ads, but it’s not limited to paid efforts. 

Media buying, on the other hand, is all about execution. It’s where you purchase ad space whether that’s paid social, display, broadcast, or out-of-home, then negotiate rates and placements to maximize visibility and conversions. 

Put simply: 

  * Media Planning = Strategy 
  * Media Buying = Execution 



When these two processes are aligned, your marketing dollars go further and your campaigns have a greater impact. 

##  Media Planning Tips That Work 

  1. Before anything else, know your media objectives. 
  2. Prioritize audience over platforms. 
  3. Use a channel scoring matrix. 
  4. Build campaigns around key content anchors. 
  5. Align planning with buying cycles. 
  6. Measure backward from business goals. 
  7. Keep it collaborative, not siloed. 
  8. Let data shape, not dictate, your plan. 
  9. Choose automation tools that fit your workflow. 
  10. Stick to a cadence, then optimize. 



I’ve seen great content underperform simply because it wasn’t part of a clear, strategic media plan. Over the years, I’ve built systems for startups and scaled brands alike. While every plan is different, there are a few core principles I return to again and again. 

These are the strategies that keep campaigns focused, efficient, and effective. 

###  1\. Before anything else, know your media objectives. 

Jumping into media planning without a clear objective is like building a house without a blueprint. I’ve seen teams pour hours into content production, only to realize later it didn’t ladder up to any real business goal. 

The best plans start with a sharp focus whether that’s brand awareness, lead generation, or product adoption. That focus should guide every channel and creative decision that follows. 

###  2\. Prioritize audience over platforms. 

Content doesn’t perform just because it’s on the latest platform. It performs because it meets the right person at the right time in the right place. 

According to [ Alex Orap ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aorap/) , founder of social listening platform [ YouScan ](https://youscan.io/) , one of the most common blind spots in media planning is the assumption that audiences are only active on mainstream platforms. 

“Real influence isn’t always happening on the loudest platforms,” Orap explains. “Sometimes it lives in more niche, authentic corners of the internet; places like Reddit or Letterboxd that traditional media plans often overlook.” 

These overlooked spaces can be cultural goldmines. For instance, Letterboxd is typically seen as just a movie review site. However, it has a rich subculture where people reflect their identities and share raw, emotional takes, not just about films, but also books, music, and podcasts. 

Ignoring these spaces means missing where real connection happens. 

###  3\. Use a channel scoring matrix. 

Media planning often starts with “Where should we show up?” However, not all channels are created equal. A simple scoring model cuts through the noise. 

I consider three factors: 

  * Cost efficiency. 
  * Reach. 
  * Ease of execution. 



If a channel ranks low across the board, it doesn’t make the cut. This approach keeps the plan grounded in value, not hype. 

###  4\. Build campaigns around key content anchors. 

Strong campaigns don’t rely on scattered content ideas. They start with one meaningful asset — a video, a webinar, a research report — and repurpose it across formats and channels. 

This keeps the message tight, the execution lean, and the performance trackable. When every piece points back to a central idea, campaigns feel more intentional and cohesive. 

###  5\. Align planning with buying cycles. 

It’s easy to plan in isolation: Create content, schedule posts, push it live. But great media planning happens when timing aligns with both audience behavior and media market dynamics. 

That might mean holding a launch until after Q4 ad rates drop or ramping up spend during your category’s peak season. Planning around demand isn’t just strategic. It’s cost-effective. 

###  6\. Measure backward from business goals. 

Media plans shouldn’t start with tactics. They should start with outcomes. What’s the business trying to achieve — more leads, faster sales, stronger retention? 

That’s the filter. Every media decision gets mapped back to a KPI. If it doesn’t support the goal, it doesn’t get planned. 

###  7\. Keep it collaborative, not siloed. 

The best media plans are cross-functional. They bring together content, design, analytics, and ops, not just for input, but for ownership. 

I’ve worked on launches that moved faster simply because everyone could see the plan, understand their role, and flag blockers before they happened. 

Visibility isn’t optional. It’s the difference between hitting deadlines and chasing them. 

###  8\. Let data shape, not dictate, your plan. 

I always review performance data before building a new plan. But I also leave room for testing and creative risk. 

Social listening is one way to find that balance, says Orap. “A strong signal is a noticeable shift in how people are talking: the tone, emotional intensity, or even the content format. If your campaign isn’t aligning with that, it’s time to reassess.” 

He adds that emerging trends like BookTok often start quietly, outside of traditional research methods. “BookTok didn’t begin in a media plan. It started with emotional, aesthetic posts from a niche group of creators. But it grew into a massive sales driver.” 

Tapping into these shifts early can mean the difference between riding the wave or playing catch-up. 

###  9\. Choose automation tools that fit your workflow. 

Tech doesn’t make a plan better. Workflow does. The right tools are the ones your team actually uses. Sometimes that’s a shared spreadsheet and scheduling app. 

Other times, it’s an integrated platform with publishing, analytics, and reporting in one place. Complexity only works when it’s matched by capacity. 

###  10\. Stick to a cadence, then optimize. 

Consistency builds momentum. Plans don’t need to be perfect to perform, they just need to show up on time. 

When content is published regularly and tied to a clear system, it’s easier to track what’s working and improve from there. A smart cadence isn’t rigid. It’s repeatable. 

##  Media Planning: The Smarter Way to Stay Visible Without Burning Budget 

Media planning is what determines whether your message reaches the right people or disappears into the void. It’s an integral part of your business’s ability to create, publish, and share content that actually lands. 

If your audience engagement tends to ebb and flow, I recommend using the pulsing media plan where you can. It gives you the consistency of continuous advertising with the intensity of flighting, ensuring a steady presence while still allowing for strategic bursts of activity. 

For example, keep a low-level awareness campaign running throughout the quarter, then ramp up during peak sales periods or key launches. 

I’ve always been surprised by how dynamic media planning can be. No two campaigns are ever quite the same, and that’s part of the challenge (and the excitement). One brand might surge during holiday season, another might need to stay top-of-mind year-round through evergreen content. Each one demands its own rhythm. 

The key is knowing _when_ and _where_ to show up. Map your media calendar to your audience’s behavior, and your planning becomes a growth engine not a guessing game.
