Updated:  08/28/25 

Sales used to feel like a blank canvas every time I picked up the phone. No map, no rhythm, just intuition and hustle. That might work in the short term, but if you’re trying to scale, guessing isn’t a strategy. I learned that the hard way. 

The turning point came when I built my first real sales process. Not a script, not a checklist, but a repeatable, flexible system that helped me turn strangers into customers, without burning out or winging every call. I’ve since helped sales teams, from startups to enterprise orgs, craft, test, and refine processes that actually drive results. 

[ ![Free Download: Sales Plan Template](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b91f6ffc-9ab7-4b84-ba51-e70672d7796e.png) ](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/b91f6ffc-9ab7-4b84-ba51-e70672d7796e)

A good sales process won’t turn you into a robot. What it will do is give you structure when things get messy. It lets you track what works, troubleshoot what doesn’t, and guide buyers through the journey instead of pushing them down a funnel. 

In this post, I’ll break down exactly what a sales process is, why it matters, and how to build one that aligns with the way modern buyers actually buy. Let’s get into it.

**What is a sales process?**   


In my experience, a sales process is more than just a checklist. It’s the blueprint that keeps your team aligned, your deals moving, and your pipeline healthy. It’s the system behind the strategy: the repeatable steps that turn cold leads into closed revenue. 

A good sales process brings structure to chaos. It helps new reps ramp faster, gives veterans a framework to improve, and gives sales leaders clear data to coach with. Whether you’re prospecting, running discovery, or closing, the process serves as your compass. You’re not guessing what comes next. You’re leading the buyer through a journey with purpose. 

At its core, **a sales process outlines every stage of your customer conversation** , from that first cold touch all the way through to post-sale expansion. And while no two deals are ever the same, having a process means you don’t have to start from scratch every time. It gives your team clarity, consistency, and control over outcomes. 

If you’re trying to scale, optimize, or just stop losing deals in the middle of the funnel, your sales process is where you start.

###  **Why build a sales process?**

Because sales without structure isn’t just inefficient, it’s unsustainable. 

When I first started selling, I was hustling hard but flying blind. Every lead felt like a gamble. Some days, I was closing fast. Other weeks, I couldn’t get a single reply. I had no idea what was actually working because there was no system to track or improve. It wasn’t a strategy. It was survival. 

That changed the moment I committed to building a sales process. Suddenly, I had clarity. My team had language. My manager had visibility. And my pipeline had consistency. 

A structured sales process turns chaos into a system you can teach, tweak, and scale. It creates checkpoints at every stage, so you know where deals stand, what actions move them forward, and how to course-correct when things stall. It’s how you turn instinct into intelligence. 

And the numbers back it up. According to [ Forecastio’s 2024 analysis ](https://forecastio.ai/blog/sales-process-optimization) , organizations that follow a formal sales process report 28% higher revenue than those without one. That lines up with what I’ve seen in the field. After helping a client standardize their process, we watched their win rate climb from 18% to over 25% in just six months. 

We didn’t change the product or double the outreach volume. We just aligned around a consistent, testable process. 

Beyond the metrics, here’s what a strong sales process gives you: 

  * It shortens ramp time. New hires don’t need to guess; they follow a proven path. 
  * It improves cross-functional alignment. Sales, marketing, and success all speak the same language. 
  * It enables better coaching. You can measure skill gaps and fix them with precision. 



If you want predictable revenue, scalable training, and real accountability, build a sales process. Then evolve it. That’s how you get repeatable wins, quarter after quarter. 

Next, let’s break down what a modern sales process actually looks like. 

##  **Sales Process Steps**

![sales process steps: prospect, connect and qualify, research, pitch, handle objections, close, nurture](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-1-20250821-3005195.webp?width=650&height=601&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-1-20250821-3005195.webp)

###  1\. Prospect. 

[ Prospecting ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/prospecting) isn’t about blasting cold emails into the void or dialing until your voice gives out. It’s about precision: knowing exactly who you’re reaching out to, why they should care, and how you’ll earn their attention in a world full of noise. 

Early in my career, I believed that volume would deliver results. I was wrong. Quality over quantity became my mantra. Once I focused on intent-driven prospecting instead of desperate outreach, everything changed: My reply rates improved, calls warmed up before I even spoke, and I stopped wasting time on the wrong targets. 

Here’s how I approach it now: 

  * **Define my ideal customer profile (ICP)** . Who fits our solution, and which in-market signals matter most? 
  * **Use smart tools** . Apollo is best for verified contacts, Sales Navigator for signs like job changes, and Bombora/6sense for intent insights. 
  * **Double-check timing** . Even tech doesn’t replace real judgment: company fit, contact relevance, and context still matter. 
  * **Personalize** . Not just “Hi ,” but referencing their product, blog, or a recent hire. 
  * **Multi-channel cadence** . Short, value-first messages across email, call, and LinkedIn. I treat the first touch like a handshake, not a pitch. 



I agree with [ Leadsforge’s recent audit ](https://www.leadsforge.ai/blog/low-response-rates-6-proven-solutions) : “Modern buyers expect personalization, precision, and relevance,” which translates to a 22% higher open rate and significantly improved reply rates. 

The best reps I know don’t start with selling. They start with curiosity. That’s prospecting: The art of learning enough about someone to open a meaningful conversation. 

###  2\. Connect and qualify leads. 

Once you’ve identified promising prospects, the next step is to start the conversation and figure out if they’re truly worth pursuing. [ Lead qualification ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/ultimate-guide-to-sales-qualification) isn’t about pushing forward just because someone responded. It’s about focusing your energy where it matters most: on opportunities with real potential. 

I usually begin with a value-driven message, whether it’s through email, LinkedIn, or a brief phone call. The goal is to explore their challenges, priorities, and buying process. To guide those conversations, I lean on frameworks like [ BANT ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/bant) (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) or [ CHAMP ](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-champ-methodology-help-you-find-sales-ready-leads-neilson-heehc) (Challenges, Authority, Money, Prioritization). These help me quickly evaluate whether the lead fits our ICP and deserves the next step. 

And there’s data to back this up. According to [ UserGems’ April 2025 guide ](https://www.usergems.com/blog/lead-qualification-guide) , the most effective qualification processes involve gathering multiple signals early on. Things like company size, seniority of the contact, recent funding, past engagement history, and media visibility. Meanwhile, [ Nimble’s 2025 CRM report ](https://www.nimble.com/blog/crm-best-practices-for-lead-scoring-qualification) highlights that scoring leads using both firmographic data and behavioral triggers can significantly boost conversion rates. 

Here’s how I typically handle this step: 

  * I run a short discovery call (usually 15 to 20 minutes) where I ask about current initiatives, pain points, and any platforms or tools they’re evaluating. 
  * I check the qualifiers one by one:   
**Budget:** Do they have funds allocated or forecasted?   
**Authority:** Am I speaking with someone who influences or makes decisions?   
**Need:** Is there a clear problem that our solution addresses?   
**Timeline:** Are they planning to act soon, or is this for next quarter? 



I also apply a simple scoring model in my CRM. This helps me rank leads based on what they say and what they do, like if they opened my email twice, clicked the demo link, or downloaded a case study. 

Taking the time to qualify properly might feel slower at first, but it pays off. I’ve seen teams double their email-to-meeting conversion rate just by getting disciplined at this stage. It’s how you stop guessing and start building a real pipeline. 

###  3\. Research the company. 

Before any meeting, I treat research like reconnaissance. It’s not just checking a LinkedIn page and calling it a day. It’s about understanding the company’s context: what they care about, where they’re going, and how we fit into that picture. Without this step, you're not selling solutions, you’re guessing. 

When I was new to B2B sales, I’d jump into discovery calls with minimal prep. I’d ask generic questions and get surface-level answers. It wasn’t until I started doing deep, pre-call research that I noticed the shift. Prospects leaned in. They said things like “Wow, you actually did your homework.” That’s when deals started moving faster and closing bigger. 

My company’s research process focuses on three layers: 

  1. **Strategic triggers** . What’s changing in their world? Are they expanding, hiring, launching a new product, or announcing a shift in focus? I track this through Google News, Crunchbase updates, and recent press releases. 
  2. **Tech stack and tooling.** What tools are they using today, and how do those tools signal gaps we can solve? I use platforms like BuiltWith, Slintel, and Wappalyzer to audit their stack. If I see tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Gong, I know what conversations to prepare for and where integrations can play a role. 
  3. **Buyer behavior.** How are their stakeholders showing up online? I scan the LinkedIn activity of decision-makers, read their blog posts, or pull quotes from interviews and podcasts. If the VP of Sales says, “Our outbound funnel is leaking,” I use that language in the first call. It shows I’m tuned in to their reality. 



According to [ LinkedIn’s 2024 State of Sales Report ](https://www.linkedin.com/business/sales/blog/strategy/what-b2b-buyers-want-data-to-inform-your-sales-strategy) , 76% of buyers expect sales reps to know their company before reaching out. Sellers who lead with research are 2.3 times more likely to connect with decision-makers. That lines up with what I’ve seen firsthand. Reps who come prepared build credibility fast. Reps who don’t lose the room before the pitch even starts. 

Bottom line: Research isn’t a task to check off. It’s your competitive advantage. Know their world better than they do, and you’ll stand out before you even say your name. 

###  4\. Give an effective pitch. 

A good pitch doesn’t sound like a pitch. It feels like a mirror, where the buyer sees their pain, their goals, and a believable path forward. I learned this the hard way. Early on, I thought pitching was about reciting benefits and features like a checklist. But the more I did that, the more glazed-over looks I got. That changed when I started tailoring my message to what the buyer actually cared about. 

Today, my pitch strategy is built around context, not slides. I walk in with three things crystal clear: their business priorities, the problem we solve, and the cost of inaction. I frame the conversation around _their_ language, not mine. Instead of “Here’s what we do,” I lead with “Here’s what you told me you’re dealing with, and how others in your space solved it.” 

I’ve found that simplicity and structure win. My pitch framework goes like this: 

  1. **Recap the problem.** . “From what you’ve shared, you’re seeing a drop in outbound conversion and struggling with rep productivity.” 
  2. **Paint the impact.** “In similar teams, that’s led to long sales cycles, burnt-out SDRs, and missed revenue goals.” 
  3. **Position the solution.** “Here’s how we helped a team like yours cut ramp time in half and increase meetings booked by 35% in 60 days.” 
  4. **Invite the conversation.** “Would it make sense to explore what that could look like for your team?” 



The best pitches don’t pressure. They create clarity. According to [ Gong’s analysis ](https://www.gong.io/blog/sales-pitch-examples/) of over 500,000 sales calls, top-performing reps speak less than 43% of the time during a pitch and ask 2.4x more engaging questions than their lower-performing peers. That statistic tracks with my own experience: Real conversations beat polished monologues every time. 

What really matters is this: Your pitch isn’t a presentation. It’s a pivot point. Done right, it moves the prospect from uncertain to curious, and curiosity is where sales momentum begins. 

###  5\. Handle objections. 

Objections aren’t rejections. They’re a sign of interest, but masked by doubt, risk, or confusion. Once I understood that, I stopped fearing objections and started welcoming them. Because when a buyer pushes back, they’re actually letting you in. You just have to know how to respond without getting defensive or going into pitch mode. 

Most objections fall into four buckets: price, priority, fit, and trust. And each one needs a different approach. When someone says, “It’s too expensive,” they usually mean “I’m not convinced of the ROI.” When they say, “We’re already working with someone,” it often means “Switching feels risky.” If you don’t pause to understand the _real_ reason behind the words, you’ll either over-talk or underdeliver. 

Here’s how I handle it: 

  1. **Listen fully before jumping in.** Most reps interrupt too early. 
  2. **Acknowledge the concern.** “That makes total sense. Others I’ve worked with felt the same way.” 
  3. **Ask a follow-up question to uncover the root.** “Can I ask what specifically feels like a blocker right now?” 
  4. **Reframe with proof.** Share a relevant success story or stat tied to _their_ problem. 



For example, if a prospect says, “We’re not sure the timing is right,” I’ll respond with something like, “I hear you. One of our clients said the same thing, but after implementing, they actually accelerated their pipeline by 22% in Q1. Would it help to walk through how they approached it?” 

According to [ Salesforce’s 2023 “State of Sales” report ](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-sales/) , 78% of high-performing sales reps say objection handling is a key differentiator, and reps who frame objections as collaborative problem-solving close deals 36% more often than those who get combative or rigid. 

In my own consulting work, I’ve seen this too. One startup I coached reduced stalled deals by 41% just by shifting how their reps responded to the “not now” objection, turning it into an opportunity to requalify and reschedule with clarity. 

[ Objections ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/handling-common-sales-objections) aren’t walls. They’re doors. The best sellers don’t bulldoze through them — they knock, listen, and walk through together.

###  6\. Close the deal. 

Closing isn’t a magic line or a pressure play. It’s the natural outcome of doing everything else right. If you’ve qualified well, uncovered real pain, delivered value, and handled objections with empathy, then closing is just clarity. Not coercion. 

Early in my career, I’d get anxious near the end of the sales cycle. I’d either push too hard or hesitate too long. Neither worked. What I learned is that closing is about helping the buyer make a confident decision, not backing them into one. 

I don’t ask for the sale: I confirm alignment. I’ll say, “Based on everything we’ve discussed, does it make sense to move forward?” or “Is there anything holding us back from getting started this month?” These questions shift the dynamic from pitching to partnering. They give the buyer space to be honest while keeping momentum intact. 

Timing matters too. I always recap the pain, the impact, and the agreed outcomes before talking next steps. That way, the value is fresh in their mind. If legal or procurement delays pop up, I stay close and communicate frequently, not forcefully. Patience with urgency. That balance matters. 

And when a deal goes quiet, I don’t just “circle back.” I re-spark with context. Something like, “I know timing was tricky last quarter, but I saw your team is hiring in RevOps, usually a sign of process changes. Would it make sense to revisit this?” 

According to [ Gong’s 2024 “Closing the Deal” analysis ](https://www.gong.io/resources/labs/the-best-sales-insights-of-2024/) , top-performing reps use collaborative language 48% more often in closing conversations and are 3.1 times more likely to confirm next steps with clear ownership on both sides. 

I’ve seen this firsthand. At one SaaS company I advised, we rewrote all closing email templates to center around buyer goals, not product features. Within six weeks, close rates jumped by 19%. 

Closing isn’t about being clever. It’s about being clear, aligned, and intentional. If you’ve done the work, the close should feel like the most natural part of the process. 

###  7\. Nurture and continue to sell. 

The sales process doesn’t end at “Closed Won.” That’s just where the next opportunity begins. 

In my experience, the best reps aren’t obsessed with the finish line. They’re obsessed with the relationship. After the deal is signed, they don’t vanish. They check in. They bring insights. They add value when no one is asking. Because they know the real metric isn’t just revenue: It’s retention, referrals, and expansion. 

I always map out a post-sale touchpoint sequence. It starts with a short message the week after onboarding, just to make sure they feel supported. Then I set monthly reminders to send helpful articles, invite them to webinars, or simply ask, “How are things going?” No pitch. Just presence. 

When there’s value alignment, I introduce case studies that relate to their vertical. If I notice usage drop-offs or gaps in product adoption, I bring in success teams early. And if I uncover a new initiative or hire, that’s my cue to explore [ cross-sell ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/cross-selling) opportunities with curiosity, not assumption. 

Maintaining engagement after the initial sale is crucial; without it, expansion stalls and customers drift. According to [ Outreach’s “Sales 2024: A Revenue Data Analysis,” ](https://www.outreach.io/resources/blog/aug-2024-product-recap?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com) organizations that embed structured post-sale outreach, like renewal reminders and tailored check-ins, report a significant uptick in both expansion and renewal conversions. 

In line with that, I reorganized our account strategy to include proactive QBRs and executive check-ins starting 90 days post-launch. In just six months, this approach boosted our average deal expansion by over 20% and reduced churn by 15%. 

Here’s the truth: [ Retention ](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-retention-strategies) is the new acquisition. And the best time to earn your next sale is right after the last one. 

##  **How to Improve Your Sales Process**

I still remember the first time I tried to “fix” our broken sales process at a SaaS startup I was working with. We had reps closing deals, sure, but it felt chaotic. One rep would book a demo after two touchpoints. Another would need 12. Some prospects went from cold to close in two weeks. Others took four months for the exact same solution. 

Sound familiar? 

I thought I could solve it by throwing more tools at the problem. Better CRM tracking. Fancier email sequences. More detailed call scripts. But after three months of “improvements,” our conversion rates actually dropped. Our average deal cycle got longer, not shorter. And the team was more confused than ever. 

That’s when I realized something that changed how I approach sales process optimization: You can’t improve what you don’t understand. And you can’t understand what you don’t measure. 

Since then, I’ve helped optimize sales processes across industries, from early-stage startups in Brazil to enterprise teams at IBM and 3M. I’ve tracked over 11,519 cold calls, analyzed 335 booked meetings, and studied why 69.1% of my SQLs converted while others stalled in the pipeline. 

The patterns became clear. Great sales processes aren’t built on guesswork — they’re built on data, buyer behavior, and relentless iteration. And the research backs this up: According to a recent Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report, [ misaligned sales processes are significant barriers to revenue growth ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241121546948/en/Harvard-Business-Review-Analytic-Services-Report-Highlights-Costly-Revenue-Risks-From-Misaligned-Sales-Processes) , with fragmented go-to-market processes leading to missed opportunities and revenue loss. 

Here’s exactly how I approach sales process improvement, step by step. 

###  **1\. Analyze your current sales process.**

This might sound obvious, but most teams skip this step. They know something’s broken, so they jump straight to solutions. But if you don’t know _why_ your process isn’t working, you’ll just create new problems. 

I start every sales process audit the same way: I pull the last 20 closed deals and map out exactly what happened, step by step. Not what we _think_ happened. What actually happened. 

For example, when I worked with a fintech startup that was struggling with long sales cycles, we discovered something surprising. Their fastest-closing deals all had one thing in common: The prospect asked for pricing in the first call. The slower deals? Those prospects wanted to “think about it” after the demo. 

That insight changed everything. We shifted our discovery process to identify pricing-ready prospects early and built a separate track for them. The average deal cycle dropped from six weeks to three. 

This approach aligns with research from Salesforce, which found that companies using data to drive decision-making are [ 58% more likely ](https://www.salesforce.com/sales/state-of-sales/sales-trends/) to beat revenue targets than those that don’t. The data doesn’t lie, but you have to collect it first. 

Here’s what I track in every process audit: 

  * Touchpoints per deal (emails, calls, demos, follow-ups). 
  * Time between each stage (first contact to demo, demo to proposal, proposal to close). 
  * Content shared at each stage (case studies, pricing, technical specs). 
  * Drop-off points (where prospects ghost or say no). 
  * Rep variation (are some reps consistently faster/better?). 



I don’t just look at wins, either. I analyze losses and stalled deals. Often, that’s where you find the biggest process gaps. According to recent research, [ 86% of B2B purchases ](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-the-state-of-business-buying-2024/) stall during the buying process, which means our process needs to account for what happens when deals get stuck. 

**Pro tip:** Don’t rely on CRM data alone. I’ve found that CRM data is only about 60% accurate. In addition, shadow your reps, listen to recorded calls, and ask prospects directly what moved them forward or held them back. 

###  **2\. Outline the buyer’s journey for your target persona.**

Most sales processes are built around what _we_ want to do, not how buyers actually buy. That’s backwards. 

I’ve sold across five continents, and here’s what I’ve learned: Buyer behavior varies by geography, industry, and company size, but the psychology underneath is remarkably consistent. People want to feel understood before they feel sold to. 

This insight is supported by recent research showing that [ 77% of B2B buyers ](https://advertisingweek.com/the-state-of-the-enterprise-b2b-buyers-journey/) rate their latest purchase as extremely complex or difficult. The complexity isn’t in our products — it’s in navigating the decision-making process itself. 

When I map buyer journeys now, I don’t start with our sales stages. I start with buyer triggers. What happened in their world that made them start looking for a solution? Was it a new hire? A budget approval? A competitive threat? A regulatory change? 

For example, when I was selling HR tech to scaling startups, the trigger was almost always the same: They’d just hit 50+ employees and realized their manual onboarding process was breaking. That insight shaped everything: our messaging, our timing, our content strategy. 

Here’s how I map the real buyer journey: 

**Trigger → Awareness → Research → Evaluation → Decision → Implementation**

For each stage, I ask: 

  * What’s the buyer thinking and feeling? 
  * What questions are they asking internally? 
  * What content are they consuming? 
  * Who else gets involved in the decision? 
  * What could derail the process? 



I’ve found that most B2B buyers follow a 3-2-1 pattern: They’ll look at 3-5 options initially, narrow it down to 2-3 for serious evaluation, then make a final decision between 1-2 vendors. This aligns with Forrester’s finding that [ buyers rely heavily on self-service and autonomous interactions ](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-the-state-of-business-buying-2024/) to make buying decisions. 

Understanding where you fit in that progression changes how you sell. 

**The biggest mistake I see:** Assuming the first person you talk to is the decision-maker. In my experience, 73% of initial contacts are influencers, not decision-makers. Research shows that the typical buying group for a complex B2B solution [ involves 6-10 decision makers ](https://advertisingweek.com/the-state-of-the-enterprise-b2b-buyers-journey/) . Your process needs to account for consensus-building, not just individual persuasion. 

###  **3\. Define the prospect action that moves them to the next stage.**

Here’s where most sales processes get fuzzy. Reps move deals forward based on gut feel rather than clear progression criteria. I’ve seen deals marked as “75% likely to close” that were really “the prospect was polite on the last call.” 

I learned this lesson the hard way when I was tracking a “sure thing” deal for three months. The CEO loved our solution. The demos went great. The ROI was clear. Then they hired someone internally to build what we were selling. I missed all the signals because I was focused on enthusiasm instead of commitment. 

This problem is more common than most sales leaders realize. According to recent sales research, [ only 1.5% of cold calls ](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/) result in an appointment, and buyers often prefer to make decisions without engaging sales teams early in the process. 

Now, I only advance deals based on prospect actions, not prospect words. Here’s what I mean. 

  * Instead of: “They seemed interested in the demo” → I look for: “They scheduled a follow-up with their technical team.” 
  * Instead of: “They asked good questions” → I look for: “They shared our proposal with their CFO.” 
  * Instead of: “They’re evaluating options” → I look for: “They requested customer references.” 



For each stage of my sales process, I define a specific prospect action that signals genuine progression: 

  * **Prospecting → Connecting.** They agree to a discovery call (not just “send me info”). 
  * **Connecting → Researching.** They share specific details about their current process/pain. 
  * **Researching → Presenting.** They invite additional stakeholders to the demo. 
  * **Presenting → Negotiating.** They request a formal proposal with specific terms. 
  * **Negotiating → Closing.** They introduce us to procurement/legal. 



This approach has dramatically improved my forecast accuracy. When I track 335 booked meetings and convert 69.1% to SQLs, it’s because I’m only counting meetings where prospects took meaningful action to move forward. 

###  **4\. Define exit criteria for each step of the sales process.**

Exit criteria are your insurance policy against wishful thinking. They force you to be honest about deal progression and help new reps avoid the trap of chasing unqualified opportunities. 

I learned this from a painful experience early in my career. I spent six weeks nurturing a “hot” lead who kept asking for more information, more case studies, more technical details. They seemed engaged, but they never moved forward. Finally, I asked directly: “What needs to happen for you to make a decision?” Their answer: “We’re not making any software purchases this year.” 

Six weeks. Wasted. Because I didn’t have clear exit criteria. 

This experience taught me something that research confirms: According to recent studies, [ 91% of B2B companies ](https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics) failed to hit their sales quota expectations in 2023, often because sales teams spend time on deals that will never close. 

Now, for every stage of my sales process, I define what must happen before a prospect moves to the next stage: 

  * Information gathered (budget, timeline, decision process). 
  * Stakeholders identified (who else needs to approve this?). 
  * Next step confirmed (specific date, agenda, attendees). 
  * Mutual value established (they see the ROI, we see the fit). 



What disqualifies a prospect: 

  * No budget or authority (and no path to get either). 
  * No urgency (timeline is “sometime next year”). 
  * No fit (our solution doesn’t solve their core problem). 
  * No process (they can’t explain how decisions get made). 



The hardest part? Actually using these criteria. I’ve coached reps who knew their prospect didn’t meet the exit criteria but kept pushing because they “had a good feeling.” Don’t let hope override the process. 

When I stick to clear exit criteria, my close rate improves and my sales cycle shortens. Why? Because I stop wasting time on deals that were never going to close. 

###  **5\. Measure your sales process results.**

This is where most sales processes die. Teams build the process, launch it with fanfare, then never measure whether it’s actually working. Six months later, they’re back to chaos. 

I treat my sales process like a machine that needs constant tuning. Every month, I analyze: 

**Velocity Metrics**

  * Average days in each stage. 
  * Conversion rate between stages. 
  * Total sales cycle length. 
  * Time to first meeting. 



**Quality Metrics**

  * Meeting show rate. 
  * Demo-to-proposal conversion. 
  * Proposal-to-close rate. 
  * Average deal size. 



**Team Metrics**

  * Quota attainment by rep. 
  * Ramp time for new hires. 
  * Activity levels vs. results. 
  * Process adherence. 



But here’s what most people miss: I also track leading indicators. Metrics that predict future performance, which [ McKinsey research ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/looking-beyond-technology-to-drive-sales-operations) shows are crucial for optimizing sales operations and driving productivity improvements of 20-30%. 

  * Email reply rates (are we reaching the right people?). 
  * Discovery call quality (measured by questions asked/answered). 
  * Stakeholder engagement (how many people join follow-up meetings?). 
  * Content consumption (do prospects actually read what we send?). 



####  **Level 1: Humming**

When your sales process is humming, everything feels predictable: 80% of your reps hit quota consistently, new hires ramp quickly, and forecasts are accurate. 

I’ve seen this at scale-ups that nail their process early. Everyone knows their role. Handoffs are smooth. Prospects move through the pipeline at a consistent pace. 

**Key indicators:**

  * 80%+ quota attainment across the team. 
  * New hire ramp time under 3 months. 
  * Forecast accuracy within 10%. 
  * Minimal process complaints from reps. 



####  **Level 2: Experimenting**

This is where most teams live. The process works, but not consistently. Some reps crush it, others struggle. You’re constantly testing new approaches. 

I spent two years in this phase with a startup client. We’d have a great quarter, then hit a rough patch. We’d change the script, and results would improve temporarily, then plateau again. 

According to recent research, [ 76% of leaders ](https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics/) attribute improvements in sales performance to their investments in sales enablement, but many organizations still struggle with consistency. 

**Key indicators:**

  * 60-80% quota attainment. 
  * Inconsistent results across reps. 
  * Frequent process adjustments. 
  * Mixed feedback from the team. 



**What to do:** Pick one variable to test at a time. Maybe it’s email subject lines, or maybe it’s a demo structure. But don’t change everything at once, or you’ll never know what’s working. 

####  **Level 3: Thrashing**

This is sales process hell. You’re constantly switching tactics. Reps are confused. Results are unpredictable. Everyone’s frustrated. 

I’ve seen teams stuck here for years, chasing the latest sales methodology or tool, thinking that’ll solve their problems. It won’t. You need to go back to basics: Understand your buyer, simplify your process, and measure ruthlessly. 

**Key indicators:**

  * Under 60% quota attainment. 
  * High rep turnover. 
  * Constant process changes. 
  * Finger-pointing between sales and marketing. 



**What to do:** Stop thrashing. Pick a simple process and stick with it for at least one full quarter. Measure everything. Then iterate gradually. 

The goal isn’t perfection — it’s predictability. When you can accurately forecast your pipeline and consistently hit your numbers, you’ve built something scalable. 

And remember: Your sales process is never “done.” Markets change, buyers evolve, new competitors emerge. As McKinsey research shows, companies that invest in world-class sales-operations functions can realize [ improvements of 20-30% in sales productivity ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/looking-beyond-technology-to-drive-sales-operations) , which means our processes must continuously adapt. 

The best sales organizations treat process improvement as an ongoing discipline, not a one-time project. 

That’s how you go from chaos to consistency. From hoping for deals to building a predictable revenue machine.

##  **Sales Process** **Mapping**

Sales process mapping — the practice of creating a detailed, typically visual representation or guide of your sales process — can help make your sales process less abstract and easier to follow. 

Sales process map formats and structures tend to vary from organization to organization. For instance, some might elect to map their sales process via a bare-bones flow chart. Others might go with a more engaging infographic, and some might go with an in-depth written guide. Going for a more systematic approach by establishing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is also a solid option. 

The degree of detail can also differ by sales org. Some elect to give a more focused, stage-by-stage representation of their processes — like the example below, covering the lead qualification process — whereas others might go with a higher-level, more holistic overview of their processes. 

![sales process map, qualification](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/sales-process-4-20250214-9973286.webp?width=650&height=502&name=sales-process-4-20250214-9973286.webp)

Regardless of how you structure it, mapping your sales process is always best practice. I have discovered that sales — at its core — is a technical practice, supplemented by finesse and creativity. That means you need to provide your reps with a solid concept of your org’s fundamentals that’s straightforward, thorough, and easy to follow. 

In my experience, sales process mapping gives them the kind of baseline framework they can work with, refine their skills within, build upon, and reference throughout a sale. 

##  **How to Create a Sales Process**

I’ll never forget the first time I tried to reverse-engineer a successful sales process. I was working with a SaaS startup that had one rep crushing quota month after month while everyone else struggled. Instead of asking him what he was doing differently, leadership kept throwing more leads at the other reps, hoping volume would solve the problem. 

It didn’t. 

Finally, I convinced the team to let me shadow their top performer for a week. What I discovered changed how I think about sales process creation forever. He wasn’t smarter or more charismatic than the others. He just had a system. A repeatable, measurable sequence of actions that moved prospects from curiosity to commitment with surgical precision. 

But here’s what really struck me: When I asked him to explain his process, he couldn’t. He’d developed it through trial and error over two years, but he’d never documented it. It lived entirely in his head. When he eventually left the company six months later, that million-dollar process walked out the door with him. 

That’s when I realized something fundamental about sales process creation: You can’t scale what you can’t see. And you can’t improve what you haven’t systematized. 

Since then, I’ve built sales processes from scratch for startups in Brazil, enterprise teams at IBM and 3M, and consulting firms across five continents. I’ve documented what works across 11,519 cold calls, 335 booked meetings, and over $406K in closed revenue. And through all of that experience, I’ve learned that creating a sales process isn’t about copying what others do. It’s about understanding what drives results in _your_ specific context and building a repeatable system around it. 

The research backs this up: According to McKinsey, companies that build world-class sales-operations functions can realize [ one-time improvements of 20-30% in sales productivity ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/looking-beyond-technology-to-drive-sales-operations) , with sustained annual increases as high as 5-10% in some cases. 

Here’s my step-by-step approach to creating a sales process that actually drives results. 

###  **1\. Start at the end.**

Most teams build sales processes forward, from prospecting to closing. I build them backward. I start with the end goal and work my way back to the beginning. 

Why? Because if you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there. And in sales, “any road” usually leads to missed quotas and frustrated reps. 

When I worked with a fintech startup struggling with long sales cycles, I didn’t start by fixing their prospecting. I started by analyzing their closed deals. What did every winning deal have in common? What actions happened right before prospects said yes? What was the average time from final presentation to signature? 

That reverse analysis revealed something powerful: Their fastest-closing deals all had the CFO involved by the demo stage. Their slowest deals? Those where the CFO entered late in the process or not at all. 

So we redesigned the entire process around that insight. Instead of targeting IT directors first, we built sequences that reached both IT and finance simultaneously. Average deal cycle dropped from 4.2 months to 2.8 months. 

This approach aligns with research showing that companies using data to drive decision-making are [ 58% more likely to beat revenue targets ](https://www.salesforce.com/sales/state-of-sales/sales-trends/) than those that don’t. Starting with your best outcomes gives you the data foundation to build a winning process. 

Here’s how I approach “starting at the end.” 

**Step 1:** Define your outcome metrics. 

  * What’s your target win rate? 
  * What’s your ideal sales cycle length? 
  * What’s your average deal size goal? 
  * What’s your desired conversion rate between stages? 



**Step 2:** Analyze your best deals. Pull your top 10-20 closed deals from the last six months and ask: 

  * What was the first touchpoint that got their attention? 
  * How many stakeholders were involved? 
  * What content did we share at each stage? 
  * What objections came up, and how were they handled? 
  * What was the final trigger that moved them to “yes”? 



**Step 3:** Map the winning pattern. Look for commonalities across your best deals. These patterns become the blueprint for your new process. 

Starting at the end isn’t just about understanding what works — it’s about building a process that consistently recreates your best outcomes. 

###  **2\. Bring all stakeholders aboard.**

Here's a mistake I see constantly: Sales leaders build sales processes in isolation, then wonder why they fall apart in execution. 

Your sales process doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It touches marketing (lead generation and qualification), customer success (onboarding and expansion), product (demos and technical questions), finance (pricing and approvals), and even legal (contract review and compliance). 

When I was helping a SaaS company scale from $2M to $10M ARR, their biggest bottleneck wasn’t prospecting or closing — it was handoffs. Prospects would get excited during the sales process, then frustrated during implementation because customer success wasn’t aligned with the promises sales had made. 

We fixed it by involving customer success in the process design from day one. They helped us understand what types of implementations succeeded and what set customers up for churn. That insight changed how we qualified prospects and what we promised during sales conversations. 

This cross-functional approach is supported by recent research showing that [ 54% of sales leaders ](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/) say that aligning sales and marketing directly contributes to increased revenue growth. When all stakeholders are aligned on the sales process, handoffs become seamless, and customer experience improves dramatically. 

Here’s my framework for stakeholder alignment. 

Internal stakeholders to include: 

  * Sales leadership (process owners). 
  * Marketing (lead quality and messaging alignment). 
  * Customer success (onboarding and expansion insights). 
  * Product (demo strategy and technical positioning). 
  * Finance (pricing strategy and approval workflows). 
  * Legal (contract terms and compliance requirements). 



Questions to ask each stakeholder: 

  * What’s currently working well in our sales process? 
  * Where do you see prospects getting stuck or confused? 
  * What information do you need from sales to do your job better? 
  * What feedback are you hearing from customers about their buying experience? 
  * What would need to change for you to support this new process? 



The goal isn’t consensus — it’s alignment. Everyone needs to understand their role in the buyer’s journey and how their actions impact the sales outcome. 

**Pro tip:** I always assign one person from each department as a “process champion.” These champions help implement changes within their teams and provide ongoing feedback as we optimize the process. 

###  **3\. Outline the sales process steps.**

Now comes the tactical work: Mapping out each stage of your sales process with crystal-clear definitions and actions. 

I’ve found that most sales processes fail because the stages are too vague. “Discovery” doesn’t mean anything actionable. But “qualify budget, authority, need, and timeline through specific questions” does. 

This clarity is crucial because, according to recent research, [ 76% of leaders ](https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics/) attribute improvements in sales performance to their investments in sales enablement. Clear process steps are fundamental to effective sales enablement. 

Here’s how I structure sales process stages based on what I’ve built across industries. 

**Stage 1: Prospecting**

  * Goal: Identify and research qualified prospects. 
  * Key actions: Build target account lists, gather intel on triggers/pain points, personalize outreach. 
  * Exit criteria: Prospect agrees to a discovery call or responds positively to outreach. 
  * Average duration: 1-3 days for active outreach. 



**Stage 2: Connect and Qualify**

  * Goal: Confirm fit and establish interest level. 
  * Key actions: Run discovery call, confirm BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline), identify stakeholders. 
  * Exit criteria: Mutual agreement that there’s potential value and defined next steps. 
  * Average duration: 1-2 calls over one week. 



**Stage 3: Research and Present**

  * Goal: Understand specific needs and present a tailored solution. 
  * Key actions: Conduct needs analysis, prepare customized demo/proposal, and involve additional stakeholders. 
  * Exit criteria: Prospect requests a formal proposal or moves to the evaluation stage. 
  * Average duration: 2-3 weeks. 



**Stage 4: Negotiate and Close**

  * Goal: Address objections and finalize terms. 
  * Key actions: Handle pricing discussions, involve legal/finance as needed, create urgency. 
  * Exit criteria: Signed contract or clear timeline for decision. 
  * Average duration: 1-2 weeks. 



**Stage 5: Onboard and Expand**

  * Goal: Ensure successful implementation and identify growth opportunities. 
  * Key actions: Smooth handoff to customer success, schedule check-ins, explore upsell/cross-sell. 
  * Exit criteria: Customer is live and successful, and the expansion pipeline is identified. 
  * Ongoing process. 



![sales process, goal to increase win rate by 5% by the end of the quarter](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-3-20250821-882183.webp?width=650&height=354&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-3-20250821-882183.webp)

The key is being specific about what happens at each stage and what needs to occur before moving to the next one. This level of detail is especially important when you consider that sales reps spend [ only 28% of their week actually selling ](https://www.salesforce.com/sales/state-of-sales/sales-trends/) , according to Salesforce research. Clear process steps help maximize that limited selling time. 

###  **4\. Map the buyer’s journey.**

This is where most sales teams miss the mark: They design the process around their needs, not the buyer’s experience. 

I learned this lesson early in my career when I was selling HR software to growing companies. Our sales process was perfectly logical from our perspective: demo first, then pricing, then references, then contract. But from the buyer’s perspective, it felt backward. They wanted to understand pricing before investing time in a detailed demo, and they wanted to speak to references before even seeing pricing. 

Once we flipped the process to match their journey, conversion rates jumped 40%. 

This buyer-centric approach is more important than ever. Recent Forrester research shows that [ 86% of B2B purchases ](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-the-state-of-business-buying-2024/) stall during the buying process, and 81% of buyers express dissatisfaction with their chosen providers. Much of this friction comes from misaligned sales processes that don’t match how buyers actually want to buy. 

Here’s how I map the buyer's journey alongside our sales process. 

**Buyer Stage 1: Problem Recognition**

  * What they’re thinking: “We have a problem that’s costing us time/money.” 
  * What they need: Education about the scope and impact of their problem. 
  * Our response: Share industry insights, benchmarks, and diagnostic content. 
  * Common questions: “How big is this problem?” “Are others dealing with this?” 



**Buyer Stage 2: Solution Research**

  * What they’re thinking: “What options exist to solve this?” 
  * What they need: Overview of different approaches and trade-offs. 
  * Our response: Position our category, share comparison content, offer consultation. 
  * Common questions: “What are our options?” “What’s the best approach?” 



**Buyer Stage 3: Vendor Evaluation**

  * What they’re thinking: “Which vendor can deliver the best outcome?” 
  * What they need: Proof that we can solve their specific problem. 
  * Our response: Customized demos, references, pilot projects, and ROI analysis. 
  * Common questions: “Can you handle our use case?” “What will this cost?” 



**Buyer Stage 4: Purchase Decision**

  * What they’re thinking: “Is this the right investment and timing?” 
  * What they need: Confidence in the decision and a smooth buying process. 
  * Our response: Risk mitigation, implementation planning, contract flexibility. 
  * Common questions: “What if this doesn’t work?” “How do we get started?” 



![sales process, goal to increase win rate by 5% by the end of the quarter](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-4-20250821-6721986.webp?width=650&height=353&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-4-20250821-6721986.webp)

The magic happens when you align your sales actions with their mental state at each stage. When buyers feel understood rather than sold to, resistance drops dramatically. This is particularly important given that research shows [ 77% of B2B buyers ](https://advertisingweek.com/the-state-of-the-enterprise-b2b-buyers-journey/) rate their latest purchase as extremely complex or difficult. 

###  **5\. Implement changes, test, and measure.**

Here’s the truth: Your first version of any sales process will be wrong. Not completely wrong, but wrong enough that you’ll need to iterate. 

I’ve never built a sales process that worked perfectly from day one. The goal isn’t perfection. It's improvement through systematic testing. 

When I was helping a consulting firm build their outbound process, our first version had a 2.3% email reply rate and booked four meetings in the first month. Not terrible, but not great. Instead of scrapping it, we treated it like a science experiment. 

We tested one variable at a time. 

  * **Week 1** : A/B tested subject lines (reply rate jumped to 3.7%). 
  * **Week 2** : Tested different call-to-actions (booking rate improved 25%). 
  * **Week 3** : Tested sending times (18% improvement in open rates). 
  * **Week 4** : Tested personalization depth (reply rate hit 6.1%). 



By month three, we were booking 22 meetings per month with the same effort. 

This systematic approach to optimization is backed by research from McKinsey, which found that companies with strong sales-operations functions [ drive significantly higher sales productivity ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/looking-beyond-technology-to-drive-sales-operations) than companies that invest less in process optimization. 

Here’s my framework for implementation and optimization. 

**Week 1-2: Baseline Measurement**

  * Document current performance metrics. 
  * Train the team on the new process. 
  * Run a new process alongside the old one for comparison. 



**Week 3-4: Initial Optimization**

  * Identify the biggest friction points. 
  * Test quick wins (email templates, scripts, objection responses). 
  * Gather feedback from reps and prospects. 



**Month 2: Systematic Testing**

  * A/B test one element at a time. 
  * Measure impact on key metrics. 
  * Scale what works, eliminate what doesn’t. 



**Month 3+: Continuous Improvement**

  * Regular team reviews and feedback sessions. 
  * Quarterly process audits. 
  * Stay updated on market changes and buyer behavior shifts. 



**[ Key metrics ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-metrics) ** **to track:**

  * Conversion rates between each stage. 
  * Average time in each stage. 
  * Rep activity levels and adoption rates. 
  * Overall pipeline velocity and win rates. 



The most important thing? Give the process time to work before making major changes. I’ve seen too many teams abandon good processes too quickly because they expected instant results. 

Consider that recent studies show [ 91% of B2B companies ](https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics/) failed to hit their sales quota expectations in 2023. Many of these failures stem from constantly changing processes rather than optimizing existing ones. Consistency, combined with systematic improvement, is what drives long-term success. 

Remember, building a sales process isn’t a one-time project. It’s an ongoing discipline. Markets change, buyers evolve, and your process needs to adapt with them. The teams that treat process development as a core competency are the ones that build predictable, scalable revenue machines. 

When you start at the end, align all stakeholders, define clear stages, map the buyer’s journey, and optimize through testing, you’re not just creating a sales process. You’re building a competitive advantage that compounds over time. 

##  **Sales Process Flowchart**

A sales process flowchart is a document that shows the steps each salesperson should take as they nurture a lead from prospect to customer. What distinguishes a sales process flowchart from other documents is that it features yes/no scenarios, providing action items depending on the customer’s response. 

The chart guides your team so customers have a uniform experience regardless of the rep they talk to. While you can create complex yes/no scenarios, you can also create a simple flowchart that shows the process from beginning to end. Below is an example: 

![sales process flowchart](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-5-20250821-3313840.webp)

Now that we’ve covered the details of creating and mapping your sales process, let’s review the answer to a common question: What’s the difference between a sales process and a sales methodology?

##  **Sales Process vs. Sales** **Methodology**

I think understanding the distinction between a sales process and sales methodology is essential. Although closely related, a sales process and sales methodology are two very different things. 

As we reviewed above, a sales process is a concrete set of actions your sales team follows to close a new customer. 

A sales methodology is the framework backing your sales processes, practices, and tactics. It’s more of a philosophy than a set of steps. 

Here’s a diagram to help you visualize this: 

![sales process: mapping the buyers journey](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-6-20250821-167425.webp?width=650&height=277&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-6-20250821-167425.webp)

I like to think of your sales process as the high-level map of the steps your team takes, while your sales methodologies are the different ways your team can approach the sales process. 

###  **Sales** **Methodologies**

Choosing a [ sales methodology ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/6-popular-sales-methodologies-summarized) sets the foundation for your team as they approach your sales process. You might choose to incorporate one, as they are another way to streamline your customers’ buyer journey and ensure professional, impactful, and helpful interactions between those customers and your sales team. 

Here are five popular sales methodologies. 

####  **1\. Challenger Sales Methodology**

The [ Challenger Sales method ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/6-popular-sales-methodologies-summarized) is an approach to sales that says the seller, or Challenger, must teach the prospect. Sellers learn about a customer’s business, tailor their selling techniques to their needs and pain points, and challenge any of their preconceptions throughout the process. 

####  **2\. Solution Selling**

[ Solution selling ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/6-popular-sales-methodologies-summarized) requires reps to focus solely on the customer’s pain points instead of only selling products or services. Products are framed as solutions, and emphasis is placed on the customer’s pain point. 

####  **3\. The Sandler Selling System**

[ The Sandler Selling System ](https://www.sandler.com/sandler-selling-system/) says the buyer and seller are equally invested in the sales process. Good sales managers train their reps to address customer objections early to save valuable time for both parties. And the buyer is almost convincing the seller to make the sale. 

####  **4\. Consultative Selling**

[ Consultative selling ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/elements-consultative-sales-process) emphasizes that the salesperson becomes a trusted advisor to the customer, gaining authority and trust over time. Consultative selling happens when the sale aligns with the customer’s buying experience. In other words, the customer–rep relationship defines the sale. 

####  **5\. Inbound Selling**

The [ inbound sales approach ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/inbound-sales-methodology) is characterized by attracting buyers with tailored and relevant content rather than advertising irrelevant messages and hoping they’ll buy. 

![inbound selling sales methodology: identify, connect, explore, advise](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-7-20250821-7856236.webp?width=650&height=529&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-7-20250821-7856236.webp)

With so many choices in today’s marketplace, I think it’s imperative that sales teams put the needs of their buyers ahead of their own. 

The inbound approach came from the belief that: 

  * Buyers can now find most of the information (online or elsewhere) they need about a company’s products or services before engaging with a salesperson. 
  * Buyers have become better at blocking out cold and interruptive sales techniques (cold calls and irrelevant sales emails, for example). 
  * Buyers have heightened expectations around the experience of buying. They can control the experience and move through the process primarily on their own timeline. 



These shifts in buying trends are examples of how buyers have seized control of the sales process from the sales reps who once held all the power. 

With these changes in mind, I believe it’s important for sales teams to adopt a more helpful, human approach to selling — or [ inbound selling ](https://www.hubspot.com/sales/inbound-sales?_ga%3D2.209962844.874358732.1559569011-1493293515.1553017609) . 

##  **Sales Process** **Examples**

###  **1.** **[ Beyond Business Groups’ 7-Step Selling Process ](https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/sales-process/) **

![sales process example: seven steps - prospect, preparation, approach, present, overcome objections, close, follow up](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-8-20250821-2206954.webp?width=650&height=389&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-8-20250821-2206954.webp)

The seven-step sales process is one of the most popular because it includes both overcoming objections and following up after the close. With this approach, sales reps have more opportunities in front of the prospect, which can work in their favor when it’s time to finalize the deal. 

Beyond Business Group takes a unique approach to this traditional process by combining prospecting and lead qualification, but it’s nearly identical to the seven-step process we featured above. 

####  **A seven-step sales process is best for:**

I find this process is great for B2B products and services that are used by large, diverse teams and departments. The longer process gives the prospect’s colleagues more time to interact with the sales rep and weigh in on the purchasing decision. 

###  **2.** **[ Ring Central’s 6-Step Sales Process ](https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/sales-process/) **

![ring central’s 6-step selling process: aligns buyer and seller actions across the three stages of awareness, consideration, and decision](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-9-20250821-6131218.webp?width=650&height=501&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-9-20250821-6131218.webp)

This unique sales process is six steps and the visual not only explains what sales reps are responsible for, but it also explains what the consumer does during each of the steps. The primary difference between the six- and seven-step sales processes is the separation of inbound and outbound prospecting, and it doesn’t include a follow-up after the close. 

####  **The 6-step sales process is best for:**

B2B and B2C companies will have success with a six-step sales process because it doesn’t require a lot of interaction with the customer. If your business sells products or services that have a short life span, I think this shorter sales process could work for you. 

###  **3.** **[ Zendesk’s 5-Step Sales Process ](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-process-steps/) **

![zendesk’s 5-step sales process: prospect, qualify, quote, close, win](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/53/hubfs/Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-10-20250821-1275358.webp?width=341&height=1024&name=Social-media-follow-and-share-buttons-10-20250821-1275358.webp)

As the shortest of the sales processes with just five steps, it takes the prospect from start to finish with only the most critical touchpoints. With fewer touchpoints, emphasis is not placed on research or objection handling. Instead, the sales rep spends time qualifying and pitching to close the deal. 

####  **The 5-step process is best for:**

For B2B products and services that are centralized to a specific team at a prospect’s company, the five-step process would be suitable. Rather than spending time getting buy-in from other stakeholders, sales reps can focus on one point of contact over a shorter period of time. This process can also work for B2B products and services that are purchased infrequently like vehicles, appliances, and life insurance. 

##  **Common Sales Process Mistakes**

Over the past 17 years, I’ve made every sales process mistake in the book. Some mistakes cost me individual deals. Others cost entire quarters. But the biggest mistake I ever made nearly killed a promising startup I was helping scale. 

We were a B2B SaaS company growing fast — too fast, it turned out. We had three reps hitting quota consistently, so leadership decided to hire five more and “just teach them what the top performers do.” Simple, right? 

Wrong. 

What we discovered was painful: Our top reps weren’t following any documented process. Each had developed their own system through trial and error, and those systems were completely different. When we tried to scale by hiring more people, we had no consistent process to teach them. New reps floundered. Pipeline quality dropped. Deal cycles stretched. Our growth stalled, and two reps quit in frustration. 

That’s when I learned the hard truth: You can’t scale what you haven’t systematized. And you can’t systematize what you haven’t defined. 

Since then, I’ve helped dozens of companies avoid the process pitfalls that kill growth. I’ve seen teams lose millions in revenue because of vague stage definitions, misaligned methodologies, and a dozen other “small” mistakes that compound over time. 

The good news? Most sales process mistakes are fixable once you know what to look for. Based on my experience across 11,519 cold calls, 335 booked meetings, and over $406K in closed deals, here are the seven most dangerous sales process mistakes and how to avoid them. 

###  **1\. Leaving Sales Process Steps Open to Interpretation**

This is the mistake that nearly sank that startup I mentioned. We thought we had a clear sales process because we’d labeled our CRM stages: “Prospecting,” “Discovery,” “Demo,” “Proposal,” “Negotiation,” “Closed.” 

But when I interviewed our reps individually, I discovered something shocking: No two people defined these stages the same way. 

One rep moved prospects to “Demo” after they agreed to a call. Another waited until they’d actually delivered the demo. One rep considered someone in “Proposal” if they’d sent pricing. Another only moved them there after receiving a formal RFP. 

The result? Our pipeline was meaningless. Forecasts were wildly inaccurate. And new reps had no idea what they were supposed to do at each stage. 

This problem is more common than most leaders realize. As I mentioned earlier, [ 91% of B2B companies ](https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics/) failed to hit their sales quota expectations in 2023, often due to process ambiguity that leads to inconsistent execution. 

Here’s how I fix this mistake. 

I define each stage with three elements: 

  * **Entry criteria** : What must happen for a prospect to enter this stage? 
  * **Key activities** : What specific actions should the rep take? 
  * **Exit criteria** : What must occur before moving to the next stage? 



For example, instead of a vague “Discovery” stage, I might define: 

  * **Entry** : Prospect has agreed to a scheduled discovery call. 
  * **Activities** : Qualify BANT, identify decision-makers, and understand the current process. 
  * **Exit** : Mutual agreement on problem definition and next steps confirmed. 



When every rep knows exactly what each stage means, your pipeline becomes predictable and your coaching becomes targeted. 

###  **2\. Expecting One Sales Methodology to Be the “Silver Bullet”**

I’ve seen too many sales leaders fall in love with a methodology (Challenger, SPIN, Sandler) and try to force it onto every situation. 

Early in my career, I was obsessed with Challenger methodology. It worked brilliantly for complex B2B sales where we needed to disrupt the status quo thinking. But when I tried to apply the same approach to inbound leads who were already ready to buy, it backfired. I was challenging prospects who just wanted to understand pricing and timelines. 

The truth is, different situations require different approaches. The methodology that works for enterprise deals might fail for SMB transactions. What works for a new business might not work for expansion sales. 

My approach to methodology selection is to match methodology to context. 

  * **Challenger** : Complex sales where prospects are comfortable with the status quo. 
  * **Consultative Selling** : When prospects know they have a problem but need help defining the solution. 
  * **Solution Selling** : For competitive situations where differentiation is key. 
  * **Inbound/BANT** : For warm leads who are actively evaluating solutions. 



The key is training your team to recognize which approach fits each situation, not forcing one methodology onto every interaction. 

###  **3\. Forgetting Your Sales Process Will Always Be a Work in Progress**

One of the biggest mistakes I see is treating sales process creation as a one-time project. Leadership spends months building the “perfect” process, rolls it out with great fanfare, then never touches it again. 

Markets evolve. Buyers change. Competitors adapt. Your process needs to evolve too. 

I learned this lesson when I was working with a consulting firm that had built an excellent process for selling to traditional enterprises. But as their market shifted toward more agile, tech-forward companies, their formal, lengthy process started feeling bureaucratic and slow. 

Instead of adapting, they doubled down on their “proven” process. Deal velocity dropped. Win rates declined. It took a 40% revenue miss to convince leadership that their process needed updating. 

This flexibility is increasingly important. Research from McKinsey shows that companies must [ modify and adapt their sales plans more frequently ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/looking-beyond-technology-to-drive-sales-operations) than ever before due to variable market conditions. 

I build adaptable processes by scheduling quarterly process reviews where we analyze: 

  * Which stages are taking longer than expected? 
  * Where are deals getting stuck? 
  * What new objections are emerging? 
  * How are buyer behaviors changing? 
  * What’s working better/worse than before? 



Based on these reviews, we make targeted adjustments. Not wholesale changes, but small, measurable improvements that compound over time. 

###  **4\. Not Aligning Your Sales Plays With Your Sales Process**

Having a sales process without defined [ sales plays ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-playbook) is like having a roadmap without directions. You know where you’re supposed to go, but you don’t know how to get there. 

I’ve seen this mistake cost companies millions. They’ll spend months defining their process stages, but never document what reps should actually _do_ at each stage. The result? Inconsistent execution and missed opportunities. 

When I was helping scale an HR tech company, we discovered that our best rep was sending follow-up sequences that were converting 23% better than everyone else’s. But because we hadn’t documented sales plays, that knowledge was trapped in one person’s head. 

We immediately built a [ sales playbook ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/playbooks) that captured: 

  * Email templates for each stage. 
  * Discovery questions by persona. 
  * Demo scripts for different use cases. 
  * Objection-handling frameworks. 
  * Follow-up sequences and timing. 



Within six weeks, the entire team’s performance had improved, and our overall conversion rate jumped 31%. 

This alignment between process and plays is critical. Recent research shows that [ 76% of leaders ](https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics/) attribute improvements in sales performance to their investments in sales enablement, and documented sales plays are a core component of effective enablement. 

My sales playbook structure: 

  * **Stage-specific templates** . Email sequences, call scripts, presentation outlines. 
  * **Persona-based content** . Messaging variations for different buyer types. 
  * **Objection responses** . Proven ways to handle common pushback. 
  * **Battle cards** . Competitive positioning and differentiation points. 



###  **5\. Leaving Marketing Out of the Loop**

[ Sales and marketing misalignment ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tried-and-true-sales-marketing-alignment) is one of the most expensive mistakes a company can make. I’ve seen it destroy otherwise solid sales processes by creating friction at every handoff point. 

The worst case I encountered was at a SaaS company where marketing was generating leads based on one set of criteria, but sales had been qualifying prospects using completely different standards. The result? Marketing claimed they were delivering “qualified” leads, while sales complained that 70% of marketing leads were garbage. 

Both teams were right and wrong. They were just operating with different definitions of “qualified.” 

We fixed it by involving marketing in our sales process design. Marketing learned what sales actually needed to close deals, and sales understood the constraints marketing faced in lead generation. Together, we redefined lead scoring, improved handoff processes, and aligned on shared metrics. 

The impact was immediate: Lead-to-opportunity conversion jumped from 12% to 28% in two months. 

This alignment is backed by data showing that [ 54% of sales leaders ](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/) say that aligning sales and marketing directly contributes to increased revenue growth. 

How I align sales and marketing: 

  * **Shared definitions** . What constitutes a Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) versus a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)? 
  * **Regular feedback loops** . Weekly meetings to discuss lead quality and market insights. 
  * **Joint metrics** . Both teams measured on shared outcomes, not just departmental KPIs. 
  * **Content collaboration** . Marketing creates sales enablement content based on real objections and questions. 



###  **6\. Centering the Process on Closing Deals**

This might sound counterintuitive, but one of the biggest mistakes sales teams make is building their entire process around closing deals rather than creating value. 

I learned this the hard way early in my career when I was working for a company with an “always be closing” culture. Our process was designed to push prospects toward a purchase decision as quickly as possible. We had elaborate closing techniques, pressure tactics, and urgency-building strategies. 

The short-term results looked good. But our customer churn was horrible. Implementation success was low. And word-of-mouth referrals were nonexistent. We were optimizing for the wrong outcome. 

When I shifted to a value-first approach, focusing on truly understanding and solving customer problems, everything changed. Deal cycles got slightly longer, but deal sizes increased. More importantly, customer success improved dramatically, leading to expanded sales and referrals that more than compensated for the longer initial sales cycles. 

This buyer-centric approach is increasingly important. Recent research shows that [ 86% of B2B purchases ](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-the-state-of-business-buying-2024/) stall during the buying process, and 81% of buyers express dissatisfaction with their chosen providers, often because they felt pressured rather than helped. 

How I build value-centered processes: 

  * **Discovery before pitching** . Understand problems before proposing solutions. 
  * **Educational content** . Share insights and best practices, not just product information. 
  * **Consultative approach** . Act as an advisor, not just a vendor. 
  * **Long-term thinking** . Optimize for customer success, not just initial sales. 



###  **7\. Forgetting to Measure KPIs**

The final mistake that kills sales processes is failing to measure what matters. I’ve seen teams build beautiful, logical processes that look great on paper but fail in practice, and they never know because they’re not tracking the [ right metrics ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-metrics) . 

When I was consulting for a fintech startup, they were obsessed with activity metrics: calls made, emails sent, meetings booked. But they weren’t measuring conversion rates between process stages. When their growth stalled, they couldn’t figure out why. 

Once we started tracking stage-to-stage conversions, the problem became obvious: They were great at booking meetings but terrible at converting demos to proposals. That insight led to targeted coaching and process improvements that fixed the bottleneck. 

[ Key metrics ](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/kpis-every-field-sales-leader-should-be-measuring) I track for every sales process: 

  * **Stage conversion rates** . What percentage moves from each stage to the next? 
  * **Stage duration** . How long do prospects spend in each stage? 
  * **Overall velocity** . Time from first contact to close. 
  * **Rep performance variance** . Are results consistent across the team? 
  * **Deal quality** . Average deal size, customer lifetime value, churn rates. 



But here’s the crucial part: I don’t just collect metrics; I act on them. Data without action is just expensive reporting. 

**Pro tip** : Focus on leading indicators (activity and conversion metrics) rather than just lagging indicators (revenue and quota attainment). Leading indicators help you predict and prevent problems before they impact results. 

The most successful sales organizations I’ve worked with treat process optimization as an ongoing discipline, not a one-time project. They measure continuously, test systematically, and adapt quickly. 

Remember, your sales process is only as strong as its weakest link. Any one of these mistakes can undermine an otherwise solid system. But when you address them systematically with clear definitions, adaptive methodologies, aligned teams, and continuous measurement, your process becomes a competitive advantage that compounds over time. 

##  **Dive into your sales process to grow better.**

Creating and mapping a sales process will help your sales team close more deals and convert more leads. This will also ensure your team provides every prospect with a consistent experience that’s representative of your brand. Follow these steps to create and map a sales process tailored to your business, sales team, and customers to boost conversions and build lasting relationships today.
