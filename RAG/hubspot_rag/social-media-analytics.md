##  Social Media Analytics Reports 

Social media analytics reports provide an overview of specific metrics and data points — such as engagements and impressions — related to the content you share on various social media platforms. 

Simply put, reports are how you’ll review your social media analytics. 

Social media analytics tools (  which we’ll review next  ) make the creation of reports simple — some of these resources provide reports from one social platform at a time. In contrast, others offer reports from multiple social media. 

Either way, social media analytics reporting tools are typically customizable — meaning you can view and pull the data and reports that matter most to you and your business. 

With the tools we will review below, reports can be automatically made and shared for you. But here are some of the unique **aspects of social media analytics reports** that you can typically customize: 

  * Statistics and data points that matter to you will be displayed in the report 
  * Time frame (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, campaign start to end) 
  * Progress growth (i.e., how you’ll share your progress growth over time through a report — typically, either in the form of a snapshot or a comparison of stats in a given period).

###  1\. Set SMART social media analytics goals. 

Create and [ set SMART goals ](/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template) to help you achieve your social media analytics goals. 

By ensuring your goals are SMART, they’ll be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound and you’ll be able to focus your strategy to reach or even exceed your expectations efficiently. 

First, ask yourself, “What do I want to learn from my social media analytics?” Then, dive into each part of the SMART goal. Here’s an example of a SMART plan related to your social media analytics strategy for reference. 

[ Use a free template to help you create SMART goals and achieve them ](https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase&_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608) . 

  * **Specific:** I want to use social media analytics to identify specific data points related to my marketing tactics to determine which posts and campaigns work best in reaching and engaging our audience members. 
  * **Measurable:** I want to be able to identify some specific data points to accomplish this goal. 
  * **Attainable:** I will identify three specific data points to help accomplish this goal. 
  * **Relevant:** These data points will help my team, and I measure our success in reaching and engaging our audience members across social media channels and identify gaps or areas for improvement in our social media strategy. 
  * **Time-bound:** I want to identify these specific data points over the next month.   
  
This way, in four weeks, we can use them to measure our success in reaching and engaging audience members across social channels and identify gaps and areas for improvement in our social media strategy. 



###  2\. Decide which metrics you’ll focus on and track. 

Now it’s time to decide which [ social media metrics ](/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about) you will track. There are several commonly-tracked social media metrics for your consideration. 

Metrics may vary by social platform and which analytics tool you choose. But here are some all-encompassing metrics applicable to virtually every social channel and analytics tool to get started. 

  * **Reach** is the total number of people who have seen your content. 
  * **Engagements** are all interactions, including shares, likes, and comments. 
  * **Impressions** are the number of times content is displayed on someone’s feed. 
  * **Mentions** are when audience members or other companies reference your business and brand on social media. 
  * **Social ROI** provides insight into whether your investment in your social media marketing results in an increase or decrease in customers, sales, brand awareness, and customer loyalty. 
  * **Social listening** is when you monitor conversations about your business and brand on social media to see what customers and audience members say about you. 
  * **Likes** are when an audience member taps (or double taps) on your social content to show they’re a fan of your post. 
  * **Retweets/shares/reposts** are when audience members post your business's published content on their profiles. 



###  3\. Determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use. 

Next, determine which [ social media analytics tools ](https://keyhole.co/blog/social-media-analytics-tools/) you’ll use —  we covered some popular choices above,  but you can always review other options through a simple Google search. 

Before deciding on which tool or tools you’ll use, think about the following questions: 

  * Do you want a tool or software to help you manage your social media analytics across multiple channels and platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) or just one (e.g., Twitter)? 
  * Which metrics did you decide to track (as discussed above)? 
  * What is your budget? Do you need a tool with flexible pricing options and features that you can add to or remove over time? (To find this information, review the pricing pages like [ this page on Sprout Social’s website ](https://sproutsocial.com/pricing/) .) 
  * Which tools and software options are suited to help you achieve your SMART goals? (Check out feature pages for this type of information, like [ this page on Oktopost’s website ](https://www.oktopost.com/platform/social-media-analytics) .) 
  * Do you want your tool to integrate with your team's more powerful software to run your business (such as [ HubSpot’s CRM ](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608) , for example)? 



###  4\. Measure the success of your social media analytics efforts. 

Once you implement your social media analytics software, you’ll be able to measure the success of your efforts. 

To do this, you'll need to use the analytics tool you implemented. Depending on your software, you can create customized reports and dashboards or pull the specific details about data points you care most about. 

In addition to applying your tools to help measure your success, you may also consider your answers to the following questions: 

  * Did you achieve your SMART goals? 
  * Did the metrics you chose to focus on tell a story helpful for your business? 
  * Did the software or tool you implemented support your business needs? 



###  5\. Make necessary social media analytics adjustments. 

Once you measure the success of your social media analytics efforts, you’ll be able to determine whether or not any part of your strategy needs to be changed or updated. 

Maybe you realize one of your data points isn’t providing the level of insight into your marketing efforts across social platforms, so you need to identify a new one to measure. 

Maybe your software doesn’t allow you to customize cross-channel reports how you want to, so you must implement a new tool. 

Or, if you’re happy with how your social media analytics reporting and strategy is working, be sure to revisit your system in the future to ensure it continues to meet your expectations.
