My personal social media is full of four main things: family, friends, food, and UGC. And as I type this, I hear the former saying, “Uh, what is UGC?” 

For over a decade, I’ve been creating social media content for brands, usually in exchange for complimentary products, ranging from skincare and makeup to spicy snacks and even water pitchers. This is an example of UGC or [ user-generated content ](https://offers.hubspot.com/ultimate-UGC-guide) , which can be an extremely valuable strategy for businesses of all kinds.

##  What does UGC mean? 

User-generated content (UGC) is content originally created by customers about a specific brand or product that is then used for marketing purposes. 

This content can take any form (image, video, review, testimonial, etc.) and appear on a variety of platforms, though social media is the most common today. It’s usually not something brands pay for, but with the rise of content creators and influencers and the proven effectiveness of UGC, this isn’t always the case anymore.

###  Types of UGC in Marketing 

####  Social Media 

My guess is [ social media ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing) is the type of UGC you’re most familiar with, even if you didn’t call it that name. 

It’s the aesthetic product photo on your Instagram feed, the TikTok about a new restaurant, the cooking video reviewing a kitchen appliance, the YouTube tutorial on a new design app, and the night routine Reel on your Explore tab.

> 
> [ A post shared by Ramona 💌 (@fromramonawlove) ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1gMfU1MVFU/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

It can be a video (like my restaurant highlight below), image (like my post for Edy’s ice cream above), or even comments on a brand’s content.

Many consumers talk about products on social media simply because they want to, but brands can encourage it by asking their audiences to use specific hashtags or tag their brand, like Ulta Beauty. 

![screenshot of ulta beauty’s instagram bio, highlighting how they solicit ugc with a hashtag](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-1-20250328-1045849.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.instagram.com/ultabeauty/)

These days, a lot of brands will also [ collaborate with creators or influencers ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/influencer-marketing-power) for “sponsored” or “gifted” user-generated content. I’ve created countless TikTok and Instagram posts for these types of campaigns. 

####  Product Reviews 

According to a study [ by BrightLocal ](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/) , around 98% of consumers read reviews before making a purchase. 

I mean, think about your Amazon shopping. If you’re anything like me, you always check those reviews before adding to cart. And let’s not forget websites like G2 (seen below), Yelp, Trustpilot, and TripAdvisor, just to name a few. Reviews are [ an extremely popular and powerful form of UGC ](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-reviews-testimonials) . 

![screenshot of canva’s product review page on g2](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-2-20250328-8026648.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.g2.com/products/canva/reviews)

Like social media UGC, many consumers post product reviews unprompted because they want to spread the word about their experience (good or bad), but brands can also solicit them by offering incentives/compensation to recent buyers or other members of their audience. 

I’ve also done these campaigns, writing product reviews on retail sites like Sephora and Ulta and some third-party product-discovery apps in exchange for complimentary products. 

While product reviews can be great [ social proof ](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/psychology-social-proof) , there’s no guarantee they’ll be positive. In my experience, brands ask you to “give your honest review,” and, personally, I don’t hold back, but not everyone does. 

[ Consumer trust ](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2024/07/11/how-reviews-and-ratings-affect-clients-buying-decisions/) in the authenticity of reviews can be a major concern in UGC campaigns like these. 

####  Testimonials 

Testimonials, like product reviews, are a type of UGC where real people share their experience with your product or service. The difference here is that a testimonial is _always_ a recommendation. 

Testimonials are also usually found on a brand’s own website (like on HubSpot’s below), not third parties’ like most reviews. Some businesses share or distribute testimonials in emails or social media as part of their sales efforts, too. 

![screenshot of a customer testimonial highlighted on hubspot’s website](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-3-20250328-274123.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.hubspot.com/customer-reviews)

##  Benefits of UGC 

So why is UGC in marketing worth the hype? Three big reasons come to mind. 

###  Free or Low Cost 

Probably the most direct and appealing benefit of UGC is that brands don’t have to do much work. Today, everyone and anyone is creating content and is usually willing to do it for free or much less than it would cost brands to do it themselves. 

Good content creation is labor-intensive, so getting someone else to do it with little to no lift or budget is a huge win. 

###  Build Awareness 

When real people post about you on their social media or third-party sites, it can expose new audiences to your brand or offering. In other words, it builds [ brand awareness ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness) . 

Maybe some of your target audience ignore brand content or never check their explore feeds. If they see a friend or a creator they trust posting about a product on their own platforms, it may get their attention in a way content published directly from a brand never would. 

###  Build Trust 

In addition to being low effort, UGC is strong social proof, or evidence from fellow consumers, that what you say or show about your product is true. 

It’s no secret that a lot of people don’t trust marketers and advertisers. They think we’ll say anything to make a sale, so it speaks volumes when real consumers vouch for the claims. 

###  Why is content moderation important for user-generated campaigns? 

Even with its big benefits, UGC [ isn’t easy or without its concerns ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/UGC-controversy) . 

When content is being created externally about your brand or offering, you don’t have control over the messaging or what the final product looks like. This can lead to issues like negative commentary, misinformation about your product, and even just inauthentic content — all of which can paint a bad picture of you to buyers. 

Content moderation can help navigate and minimize these issues, but let’s unpack them a bit more. 

####  Negative Commentary 

When you create content for your brand internally, you won’t bash it, right? You’ll put your best foot forward and highlight its best qualities. 

With UGC, especially if created organically, without collaboration with your team, there’s no guarantee that this will happen. Real people are free to talk about any shortcomings, problems, or issues they have with your product or service. And, honestly, that’s partially what your audience likes about it. It’s unfiltered and candid. 

Of course, you want to believe everyone will love and have the best experience with you, but if they don’t, nothing stops people from including that in their videos, posts, reviews, etc. 

####  Misinformation 

With its unfiltered nature also comes the risk that creators could deliver _inaccurate_ information. 

No one knows your product or business better than you. When someone creates UGC, they speak from their perspective and could very well share something that is not true. I’m not saying this is done maliciously, but there’s a good chance they just didn’t know. 

For example, if someone said the HubSpot can’t integrate with PandaDoc. A quick glance at [ our integration library ](https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/content-library) will tell you that’s not true, but if someone posts a video without doing much research, they could misspeak. 

####  Authenticity 

Now, this issue is unique to sponsored UGC. As I mentioned, with organic user-generated content, you can’t control what people say or do, but when you sponsor or solicit the content, you may establish guidelines about what you want to be discussed. 

This is great for you as a brand but censors the content and makes it a bit less trustworthy and authentic. If a piece is sponsored, how can your audience know for sure that the opinion shared is true? Modern consumers are becoming more aware of this, which can certainly impact how much they trust your brand.

##  UGC Strategy 

###  How to Get UGC for Your Brand 

Here are some tried and true tips you can use to collect user-generated content for your brand. 

####  1\. Create a hashtag. 

Creating and promoting a “branded” hashtag is likely the most well-known way to encourage people to create UGC for your brand. 

Plus, it’s easy and establishes a nice, central place where you and consumers can see all the content. People can search your hashtag and see what others like them have experienced or shared and also get their content found. 

It creates a sense of community and gathers content to spread word of your brand. REI’s #OptOutside is a great example of this: 

![screenshot showing the #optoutside hashtag ugc highlights on rei’s website](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-4-20250328-9252301.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://www.rei.com/opt-outside)

The outdoor retailer highlights UGC using its hashtag on its website and social media. 

####  2\. Add an incentive. 

Again, many people post UGC without being asked, but if you’re not getting as much as you like, sweeten the deal with an incentive. 

You may offer a discount or freebie for posting a review. Or maybe you’ll give people the chance to get reposted on your social media, like GoPro or iPhone. 

> [ View this post on Instagram  ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHGu_roJHYP/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)
> 
> [ A post shared by apple (@apple) ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHGu_roJHYP/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

Give your audience a reason other than “it would be nice” to post UGC, and they’ll be much more likely to do so. 

####  3\. Link it to a contest or giveaway. 

Another smart and exciting way to promote UGC is linking it to a contest or giveaway. 

We already know incentives work, but rather than consistently giving something small away, you can also consider hosting a giveaway or contest for a large, expensive prize, where users create content to enter. 

National Geographic did this for a few years with its #WanderlustContest on Instagram. In the campaign, their audience submitted original photographs using the hashtag and were entered to win a National Geographic Photo Expedition to Yosemite National Park.

> 
> [ A post shared by National Geographic Travel (@natgeotravel) ](https://www.instagram.com/p/4PvhoWIMdQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

####  4\. Automate “the ask.” 

Thanks to AI and automation, asking your audiences to post content is easy. 

After people make a purchase on your website, for example, you can send them an email asking them to post UGC or include the information in their order confirmation. If you have a physical product, include your hashtag and “ask” on the packing slip, like I do with my D2C brand. 

You can also use tools like [ ManyChat ](https://manychat.com/) to send users automated direct messages or social media responses with your request. 

####  5\. Get your team involved. 

While not “users” or customers per se, members of your team can be some of your most effective content creators and brand advocates. In fact, this can be extremely valuable when it comes to hiring and attracting talent. 

“Zappi employees are our brand’s biggest champions,” shares [ Roshni Patel ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpatel587/) , Director of Social Media at Zappi, calling investing in employee advocacy a no-brainer. 

“We are launching an advocacy tool to make sharing content easy and fun — complete with ready-to-use visuals, contests to drive engagement or spread brand awareness, and celebrating wins along the way.” 

“I’m also focused on educating and empowering our employees to build their personal brands while sharing their authentic experiences. Our goal is to foster a culture where employees feel confident using their voices to share their authentic experiences on social media.” 

Employee advocacy is something we use at HubSpot, using our hashtag #hubspotlife and @hubspotlife handle on Instagram.

> 
> [ A post shared by HubSpot Life (@hubspotlife) ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCR1RxbsV3-/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

####  6\. Collaborate with relevant influencers. 

[ 69% of consumers ](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/influencer-marketing-success-matter-study-2023/643310/?hubs_content%253Dblog.hubspot.com%25252Fmarketing%25252Fauthor%25252Framona-sukhraj%2526hubs_content-cta%253DHow%25252520to%25252520Get%25252520More%25252520Followers%25252520on%25252520Instagram%2525253A%2525252017%25252520Ways%25252520to%25252520Your%25252520First%25252520%252528or%25252520Next%252529%252525201000%3D%26hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing%252Fauthor%252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3DWhat%252520Is%252520D2C%252520Marketing%25253F%252520Here%252520Are%25252011%252520Tips%252520I%252520Found%252520For%252520Doing%252520It%252520Right%252520%25255B%25252B%252520Examples%25255D) trust information from influencers and their family and friends over brands. That means [ teaming up with relevant influencers ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-influencers?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgain-instagram-followers%26hubs_content-cta%3DInstagram%2520influencers=) or creators in your space to produce UGC can do wonders for your reach and brand awareness. 

But again, don’t pick any old influencer. Make sure they are relevant to your offering and can speak authentically to its value. 

As we mentioned, consumers can be skeptical about sponsored or collaborative content. They can’t be sure if the praise shared is genuine, but working with the right influencers who are trusted voices in your industry can help combat this.

**Pro tip:** Lean into niche influencers. According to the [ State of Marketing 2025, ](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing) smaller influencers can offer brands more trust with their followers, access to tight-knit communities, and more affordability. 

![graph showing the biggest benefits of small influencers reported by marketers](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-5-20250328-9107842.webp)

In fact, nearly 45% of marketers reported seeing the most success with micro-influencers, the largest of any group, followed by macro and nano-influencers. Mega-influencers (those with over a million) came in last. 

####  7\. Explore platforms other than social media. 

Not all consumers are active or even comfortable using social media. Knowing this, give them options. Ask for content for your website like testimonials or reviews on third-party sites. Social media might be the flashiest type of user-generated content, but that doesn’t mean the others don’t have value. 

####  8\. Offer something uniquely share-worthy. 

Above anything else, the best way to encourage UGC is to give your customers something special they _want_ to share and talk about. Think restaurant plating that’s like artwork or one-of-a-kind personalized content like Spotify Wrapped. 

![highlights from spotify wrapped 2024](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-6-20250328-8773477.webp)

[ _Source_ ](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-12-04/wrapped-user-experience-2024/)

When customers have a memorable experience or learn/see something interesting, they want to tell people about it. If your brand can create those, the UGC will come naturally.

##  Examples of UGC 

Now that you know some savvy ways to generate user content, here are some examples of brands already doing it well. Check out even more here: [ 10 User-Generated Content Campaigns That Actually Worked [+Expert Insights] ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-of-user-generated-content)

###  1\. Liquid Death: #MurderYourThirst 

[ Liquid Death ](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/liquid-death-anti-marketing) has to be one of the coolest water brands out there, and it’s not because the product is unique — I mean, it’s water, after all. 

The brand gives its customers that unique, shareworthy experience and culture they want to share and, in turn, has banked on great UGC.

> 
> [ A post shared by Liquid Death (@liquiddeath) ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGV6ty1pAHf/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

The company encourages its fan base to share content using #MurderYourThirst and #DeathToPlastic (as the product comes in [ recyclable aluminum cans ](https://liquiddeath.com/pages/death-to-plastic) ) on Instagram and regularly reshares some to its feed. 

It’s simple, but effective. 

###  2\. Dunkin: Charlie D’Melio Collaboration 

In 2021, Dunkin Donuts collaborated with Charli D'amelio to increase app downloads and popularity among younger consumers.

D’amelio is a popular Gen Z influencer who is frequently seen drinking Dunkin’s iced coffee in her videos (aka creating UGC content without even being asked). 

Taking note of this, the restaurant teamed up with D’amelio, launching a drink named after her that her 143 million TikTok followers were eager to try. The app's download [ increased by 57% ](https://influencehunter.com/2022/06/15/charli-damelio-and-dunkin-donuts-a-tiktok-influencer-marketing-case-study/?hubs_content%3Dblog.hubspot.com%25252525252Fmarketing%25252525252Fauthor%25252525252Framona-sukhraj%26hubs_content-cta%3Dblog-listing-pagination-label) when Dunkin Donuts released the drink and inspired thousands of additional UGC posts on social media.

###  3\. Express: Product Reviews 

Express does a great job generating and showcasing product reviews on its retail website. Every product has extensive reviews complete with a numerical rating, photos, as well as details on fit, quality, and comfort. 

![screenshot highlighting the product reviews on express’s product pages](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-8-20250328-9151488.webp)

How do they source these reviews? Express emails customers after their purchases, asking them to share their thoughts on the website. It also incentivizes reviewing for its “Insider” members, offering reward points and cash as a thank you. 

![screenshot showing how express incentivizes ugc product reviews in its insider loyalty program.](https://53.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/53/what-is-ugc-9-20250328-8808486.webp)

##  Turn your audience into advocates. 

User-generated content isn‘t just a trend—it’s a powerful strategy that builds trust, amplifies brand awareness, and drives engagement at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing. Whether through social media posts, product reviews, or testimonials, UGC allows real customers to become your most authentic brand advocates. 

As UGC continues to shape marketing strategies in 2025 and beyond, one thing is clear: the most influential voices in your brand story aren’t necessarily your own — they’re your customers.
