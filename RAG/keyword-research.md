Keyword research sounds like such a daunting task. What’s the point of researching a keyword anyway? Shouldn’t your natural marketing instincts tell you which keywords are most relevant to your business? 

![meme about keyword research](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

Not quite. In this easy guide to keyword research, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to find the best keywords for your business, including: 

  * What keyword research is and why it’s essential. 
  * The steps and tools to perform easy and effective keyword research. 
  * How to find competitor keywords, question keywords, related keywords, and more. 



Use these recommendations and tips so you can show up for exactly where your potential customers are looking! 

##  What is keyword research? 

Keyword research is the process of finding the terms people use to search for information on a topic, as well as how often those keywords are used in search engines like Google and Bing. Keyword research is the best way to find new, relevant keywords to expand your paid and organic search marketing campaigns. 

Keyword research can be conducted through a variety of tools that we’ll discuss in more detail below, but the main goal is to find the right search terms that have intent aligned with your business’s content and offerings, along with decent search volume. 

In addition to search volume, other keyword metrics may be helpful when conducting research and prioritizing which keywords to target, such as 

  *     * Cost-per-click (CPC) 
    * Competition (how difficult it is to rank for that keyword) 
    * Your own site authority. 



##  Why is keyword research important? 

[ Keywords ](/keywords) are the building blocks of not only your [ online presence ](/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence) , but your business growth. Businesses that cannot be found online will not succeed! But Google processes over [ 5.5 billion ](http://searchengineland.com/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247) search queries each day. That’s a lot of keywords! But you can’t just target any keyword. You need to do your research to find the most fruitful ones for your business. 

If your content isn’t targeting the terms and topics your audience is interested in, it’s essentially useless. But there’s an art and science to it. 

If your keyword [ search volume ](/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume) is too low, leads won’t be able to discover your ads or organic listings, visit your website, and turn into paying customers. But if the keywords you’re trying to rank for or bid on are _[ too ](/popular-keywords/) _ [ popular ](/popular-keywords/) , you might not get on the SERP at all or end up overpaying for your ad clicks. 

Without the right balance of quality keywords, your search marketing campaigns (paid and organic) will be completely misguided. 

##  When do you need keyword research? 

For digital marketers, these are the **three areas where keyword research is most critical** : 

###  #1: For SEO 

The first and most obvious reason we need keyword research is to optimize for organic search. [ Search engine optimization (SEO) ](/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics) helps Google bots crawl and index our websites to rank organically on the search engine results pages (SERPs). One of the primary ways that search engines decide what to rank is by crawling for keywords that show relevance between the user’s search query and the content on your website. 

![guide to keyword research google search page autosuggest](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

While Google is frequently changing their algorithms, keywords are likely never going to lose importance. 

###  #2: To fuel your content strategy 

We all know that [ SEO and content ](/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide) go hand-in-hand. Without content on your website, strong SEO will not follow. 

“Effective content strategies start with keyword research,” says [ Search Engine Land ](http://searchengineland.com/3-reasons-seo-belongs-beginning-project-not-end-278905) columnist Nate Dame. “Modern keyword research provides significant insight into what audiences want and need.” 

Every single piece of content on your site, whether it be a 300-word blog post or 5,000-word guide, should be [ written with SEO in mind ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/03/seo-copywriting) . That is, focused around a keyword that strikes the right balance between high search volume and competition. 

###  #3: For paid campaigns 

Marketers often think about SEO and content when referring to keyword research, but all of your [ paid campaigns should also be keyword-focused ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/11/21/ppc-keyword-research-guide) . Whether it be your paid search ads, display ads, remarketing, or social media campaigns, all of these strategies need to be keyword-focused. 

![keyword research for ppc](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

For example, with paid search you’re literally bidding on individual keywords. [ Keywords make up your ad groups, which make up your campaigns ](/blog/ws/2017/05/02/adwords-account-structure-guide) . If these keywords have low search volume, then your ads are going to get little or no traction. Also, if your keywords do not pertain to your target audience, you’re going to get the wrong people clicking on your ads, which wastes your precious budget. 

The bottom line is that keyword research is key in all search marketing campaigns! 

##  How to do keyword research: focus on INTENT! 

Before we get into the logistics of how to conduct keyword research, it’s critical to mention the importance of keyword intent. WordStream’s Content Manager, Elisa Gabbert, recently wrote a thorough post on [ intent marketing ](/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing) , which she defined as “ **any kind of marketing that aims to meet an end-user or prospect’s intent – that is, what they really want or need in the moment** .”   
You can see why this would be important for keyword research, right? If you’re unable to understand the true intent of your keywords or if the keywords you’re targeting have the wrong intent that isn’t aligned with your business goals, then they are essentially useless. 

Let’s take paid search as an example. The keywords “wedding cake” or “wedding cake ideas” show very different intent than “buy wedding cake in Boston” or even “wedding cake shops near me.” These two latter options have much [ higher commercial intent ](/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords) , meaning they indicate that the goal is to find a store and purchase a cake. 

![the four types of keyword intent](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

People searching those keywords are closer to the [ bottom of the funnel ](/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions) , the point of purchase. 

So while it makes sense to target commercial keywords with [ shopping ads, ](/blog/ws/2017/03/23/shopping-campaign-optimization) conversion-optimized landing pages, and other content that makes it **easy to buy—** the intent of higher-funnel, less commercial keywords might be better met with a [ blog post ](/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post) full of wedding cake ideas. 

Being able to truly understand your prospects’ intent is critical to being successful at keyword research and search marketing in general.

##  How to do keyword research: getting started 

Now that you understand the importance of keyword research, where do you start? Here are two easy steps to get you off to a productive start! 

###  Step #1: Brainstorm a list of broad topics related to your business 

Start thinking of the different categories and topics that pertain to your business. Start broad, and don’t worry about getting too specific right away. 

For example, if you’re a bakery you might break down your topics by the types of baked goods you sell, like cakes, quiches, croissants, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, etc. It can help to use a Google document or excel spreadsheet and create tabs for each of these main topics you’ve brainstormed. 

![keyword research brainstorm](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

###  Step #2: Use keyword tools to find specific keywords within each topic 

Alright, this is where the fun begins! You really need to put yourself in the shoes of your customer, and think how you would go about discovering your business if you were them. If you’re a marketer with little customer-facing interaction it can help to speak with your sales team to see the language that new leads typically use. 

You can start with a simple brainstorm. Let’s go back to our bakery example for this one, focusing in on the “cakes” category. Since you make cakes for special occasions you might write down some keywords like “wedding cakes,” “affordable wedding cakes,” “stylish wedding cakes,” “summer wedding cakes,” etc. Then you may focus in on other occasions that you sell cakes for like birthdays or anniversaries. You’ll then recall that people often search for specific flavors like “red velvet” and “marble.” Oh, and location is important! You should add the keyword “near me” to the end of these searches to help you show up in local results, like “affordable wedding cakes near me.” (Learn more about [ how to do local keyword research ](https://localiq.com/blog/local-keyword-research/) here!) 

![how to do keyword research](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

Should you stop there? NO! Instinct will only get you so far – it’s easy to miss whole pockets of relevant keywords that you should be targeting, or you may find that the keywords you _think_ would drive traffic are so low-volume that they won’t get you anywhere. You need to use keyword tools to make sure you’re surfacing all the relevant keywords that should be in your content plan and search campaigns. 

Type each of your main topics (“cakes,” “cookies,” etc.) into a keyword tool to get a list of [ related keywords ](/blog/ws/2020/08/27/lsi-keywords) , their associated search volume, and other data. You can also type in any specific keywords from your brainstorm session to see what kind of volume they get. 

Remember, if they’re far-fetched or too specific, [ keyword research tools ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/20/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools) will reveal that your keywords are not worth focusing on. On the other end of the spectrum, your keywords might be too broad, and result in super high search volume or a high level of competition. If you’re a small, local bakery, you wouldn’t want to compete with a global cookie company. Rather, your keywords should be more [ targeted around your location ](/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo) . 

Keyword research tools will help you discover which keywords are worth investing in. The list of the top tools below will help you determine which ones to try first.

###  #3: Moz’s Keyword Explorer

![semrush keyword research](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

##  #5: Google! 

Google itself is an underrated keyword research tool. You can start typing a keyword into Google to get more helpful suggestions. For example, see some of the keywords that appear when I type “wedding cakes” into Google. 

![google keyword research](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

“Wedding cake toppers” and “wedding cake ideas” could not only be keywords worth bidding on, but they could also be keywords worth creating additional content on. For instance, a blog post on “wedding cake ideas” or a [ comparison chart ](https://visme.co/blog/interactive-comparison-chart/) of “wedding cake prices.” 

When you’re considering keywords to target, you can also use Google to see what’s already ranking. Get a sense of the competitive landscape. Ask yourself questions like: 

  * Is the SERP highly commercial – i.e., are there lots of ads? Does it make more sense to enter the [ ad auction ](/articles/what-is-google-adwords) with an ad than try to rank organically? 
  * Are the top-ranking sites much larger than you? (It’s hard to compete with the likes of the New York Times and Buzzfeed.) 
  * Do the current results meet the intent of the keyword? If not, you could swoop in and beat them with a better answer to the question! 



You should also look for SERP features like the “People also ask” box and related searches at the bottom of the SERP. Including these additional related keywords in your content can help you meet the searcher’s intent and help your content rank!

##  How to do keyword research for competitor keywords 

Don’t forget to put your spy gear on when conducting keyword research! It’s important not to forget about the [ competition ](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis) when pursuing keywords found through keyword research. 

For instance, when a keyword has very high search volume, it can often be seen as much more competitive. But how can you be sure your competitors are ranking for such terms? Well, as mentioned, one of the easiest ways is Google! Simply Googling the keywords you’re looking to target to see what is currently ranking is a great approach. 

What about your paid search competitors? You can use the Google Ads [ Auction Insights ](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2579754?hl=en) report to see how your main competitors are doing compared to you, in terms of impression share, average position and more. 

![auction insights](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

Once you know who you’re competing with, you can use a tool like WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool or SEMRush to see what keywords they’re ranking for. Just drop in their URL instead of a keyword or topic. 

To gain background from your competitors in paid search, think about how you can be more compelling. For instance, you can add extensions to your ad or try writing more [ emotional ](/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing) , intriguing ad copy, which may entice searchers to choose your wedding cakes over the not-so-tasty cake shop down the street. 

Here are some more tips on [ how to write ads that get high CTR ](/blog/ws/2017/06/06/best-ads) (which in turn raises your Quality Score, and saves you money!). 

Several of the tools covered above also include [ competitive analysis ](/blog/ws/2021/03/16/marketing-competitive-analysis) and insight into what keywords your competitors are ranking for, so take advantage of these competitive insight features when doing your keyword research. 

##  How to do keyword research for question keywords 

One of the best ways to [ build brand trust and affinity ](/blog/ws/2017/02/08/brand-affinity-marketing) is to provide great answers to your prospects’ burning questions. 

Targeting questions allows you to get right at the problems your customers are having, in turn leading them to discover your business and engage with your content. Question keywords can also benefit you greatly in the organic search results. If your provide the highest quality answers to difficult questions, your credibility will rise, allowing you to rank higher on the SERPs. 

So how do you find these ideal questions? What questions are your searchers asking? If you can figure this out, then you’ll have a long list of informative keyword phrases to incorporate into your SEO, paid search, and content strategy. 

If you’re at a standstill when it comes to brainstorming questions, there are some really great keyword tools out there like [ Answer the Public ](http://answerthepublic.com/) . This awesome free tool, with a super weird homepage, works like so: Type in a keyword, and behold the beautiful visual that appears, with a circular display of questions grouped by the word they start with (where, which, who, how, why, etc.): 

![keyword research tools](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

If my intent was to sell wedding cakes, I could target some high-intent questions from this list, like “who sells wedding cakes” or “where to buy wedding cake.” You’ll also find higher-funnel questions that people in the market for a wedding cake need help with, like “what size wedding cake to feed 200.” 

The next step would then be using one of your keyword research tools to get search volume data for these questions, as well as other helpful metrics to ensure the keywords are worth pursuing. One strategy would be to target as many of these keywords as possible in a single “ultimate guide” type resource to planning your wedding cake. 

Learn more about [ how and why to target question keywords here ](/blog/ws/2016/08/09/question-keywords) , and find some other cool keyword tools to try in [ this post ](/blog/ws/2015/12/01/new-keyword-tools) . 

##  How to do keyword research for PPC 

Let’s take a moment to review some of the specific considerations related to keyword research for PPC, or paid search marketing. Keyword research for paid search can be a bit more daunting, since your budget is on the line. In order to spend it wisely, and actually see an ROI from the keywords you bid on, keep these four tips in mind when conducting keyword research for paid campaigns. 

###  #1: Research the associated costs for each keyword 

All of the keyword tools outlined in this post typically include metrics around the cost-per-click (CPC) associated with each word. Keeping cost in mind will help you determine if certain keywords are in or out of budget for your upcoming campaigns. 

![most expensive keywords 2017](//www.wordstream.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)

You want to ensure you’re able to bid high enough to rank in the first 0-3 slots on Google, but not so high that you’re [ paying an absurd amount ](/blog/ws/2017/06/27/most-expensive-keywords) for one single click. Pay attention to these metrics when researching and deciding on keywords for your ad groups. 

###  #2: Make sure to do negative keyword research 

Conducting [ negative keyword research ](/blog/ws/2014/03/04/negative-keyword-list) is just as important as regular keyword research when it comes to PPC, because if you’re not excluding irrelevant words you could be wasting money on irrelevant clicks. You’d be amazed how much money you can waste this way. This is especially important when using [ broad ](/blog/ws/2021/03/29/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match) or even phrase match types. 

Also, just typing your keyword into Google and seeing what appears as suggestions to search for can help you identify negative keyword terms. For instance, if you’re selling cakes, you’re probably not interested in showing up for any “recipe” queries, since I’d have to pay for those low-intent clicks. 

###  #3: Bid highest on commercial intent keywords 

Your goal in [ advertising on Google ](/blog/ws/2017/03/20/how-to-use-google-adwords) is likely not _just_ to drive clicks. If it is, well then ignore this tip! 

However, if you’re actually looking to target the most interested and qualified searchers, [ driving more conversions and sales ](/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online) , you should focus most of your budget on [ commercial intent keywords ](/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords) – such as those containing words like “buy now,” “discount,” “free shipping,” brand names, and any other terms that demonstrate the searcher is ready to make a purchase. 

While you may still need to target keywords outside of this bucket, I’d recommend allocating a higher budget to keywords with high commercial intent since they’re the most likely to have the highest return.

###  #4: Group your keywords properly 

Once you’ve identified your high-intent, commercial, appropriately priced keywords, you need to group them in order to configure your campaign. Small groupings of tightly related keywords are how you should approach structuring your ad groups. If you have a long list of keywords, and this task seems daunting, check out our resource on [ keyword grouping ](https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-grouper) .
